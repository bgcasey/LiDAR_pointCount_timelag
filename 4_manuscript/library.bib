  abstract = {We evaluated Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis) responses to changes in habitat characteristics (landscape metrics, landcover, and microhabitat features) at multiple spatial scales resulting from timber harvests (clear-cut, heavy partial, and light partial) between 1996 and 2009. Relative abundance of Canada Warblers decreased over time on our West Virginia study area (Wildlife and Ecosystem Research Forest) and within the Appalachian Bird Conservation Region. Initially, relative abundance was greater closer to roads, but as timber harvests became more common, relative abundance became positively associated with amount of light partial harvests at the local scale. Nest survival was 45.6 {$\pm$} 18.3\% during 1996-1998 and 24.9 {$\pm$} 14.6\% during 2007-2009, but did not differ (P=0.38) between these periods. Areas around nests in 2007-2009 (n=17) had less intermediate canopy cover and fewer residual trees but more green cover, woody debris, and pole trees than areas around nests in 1996-1998 (n=10). Successful nests had more low cover, less vertical diversity, more woody debris, more saplings, and greater edge density than failed nests. We found a positive association between relative abundance and all three types of timber harvests and an improvement in habitat through understory development and retention of residual trees. Our research finds preliminary support for use of timber harvests, particularly light partial harvests, as a management tool for Canada Warblers in the southern portion of their range with the need for extended research using treatments and controls to confirm successful management. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Changes in the structure of woodlands and forests, caused by shifts in management, stand maturity, and composition, have been implicated in the population decline of some bird species in Europe and North America. One such species is the Marsh Tit (Poecile palustris). We investigated relationships between Marsh Tit occupation (derived from territory mapping) and vegetation structure, tree species composition, and proximity to woodland edge in a British woodland, using a combination of 5 years of occupation data and high-resolution (0.5 and 1 m), large-scale (155 ha) habitat models derived from remote sensing. The results demonstrated that Marsh Tit occupation was linked to vegetation characteristics through the woodland's full vertical profile and related significantly and positively with overstory height, tree canopy closure, and the coverage of understory vegetation below the overstory. Marsh Tit occupation was lower within 50 m of the woodland perimeter, where habitat structure was less favorable than in the woodland interior. No preference was shown for areas rich in any particular prevalent tree species. Our results suggest that widespread changes in woodland structure resulting from abandonment by managers are unlikely to be responsible for the decline of the Marsh Tit in Britain and that reintroduction of active management that prevents woodland maturation could be detrimental to remaining populations. The study demonstrates a novel approach to integrating territory maps and remote-sensing data to permit highly detailed analyses of bird-habitat interactions and may have wider implications for woodland management and related bird species.},

Availability of airborne digital remote sensing (LiDAR) data for Monks Wood allowed the characterization of the canopy structure in territories and non-breeding areas using a three-dimensional canopy-height model. The difference between the mean canopy height of the 2004 territories and that of the unoccupied area of the study site in the same year was 1.8 m, or 14\%. Sampling the unoccupied area, with hypothetical `pseudo-territories', showed a statistically significant difference of 1.6 m (13\%) between the mean canopy heights of the `taller' 2004 territories and the unoccupied pseudo-territories. A comparison by field survey of tree and shrub species composition between the 2004 territories and pseudo-territories found no difference in species richness or the mean density of shrubs or mature trees ({$>$} 30 cm diameter at breast height, dbh). The mean density of medium-sized (5-30 cm dbh) and small ({$<$} 5 cm dbh) trees was, respectively, 1.9 and 3.9 times greater in the pseudo-territories, values that were statistically significant. Overall, Marsh Tits in Monks Wood appeared to require mature trees with a shrub layer beneath the top canopy, but avoided areas with large numbers of young and immature trees.},

Aims To investigate winter habitat selection by Marsh Tits in a British wood, testing for preferences in tree species and woodland structure. Methods Thirteen Marsh Tits were radio-tracked during the winter, and home-ranges were derived. Lidar and hyperspectral data were used to compare the vegetation structure and tree species composition of entire home-ranges and the core areas of intensive use within. Instantaneous sampling observations provided further information for tree species utilization. Results The mean home-range was very large (39 ha, n = 13). There were no significant differences in mean tree height, canopy closure, understorey height, or shrub volume between full home-ranges and the core areas of use. Core areas contained a significantly greater proportion of English Oak relative to availability in the full home-ranges. Instantaneous sampling confirmed that English Oak was used significantly more than other trees. Conclusion Selection for English Oak during winter contrasted with previous studies of breeding territories, indicating that habitat usage varies seasonally and demonstrating the need for habitat selection studies throughout the year. Large home-ranges help to explain the Marsh Tit's sensitivity to habitat fragmentation.},

  abstract = {Abundance, size, and spatial distribution of standing dead trees (snags), are key indicators of forest biodiversity and ecosystem health. These metrics represent critical habitat components for various wildlife species of conservation concern, including the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), which is strongly associated with recently burned conifer forest. We assessed the potential of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) to detect and characterize conifer snags and identify Black-backed Woodpecker habitat using previously derived empirical thresholds of conifer snag basal area. Over the footprint of the Rim Fire, a megafire that extended (similar to 104,000 ha) through a heterogeneous mosaic of conifer forests, oak woodlands, and meadows in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, we identified conifer snags and estimated their basal area from single-tree ALS-derived metrics using Gaussian processes in four major steps. First, individual trees were mapped using the Watershed Segmentation algorithm, resulting in 87\% detection of trees with stem diameter larger than 30 cm. Second, the snag/live classification model identified snags with an overall accuracy of 91.8\%, using the coefficient of variation of height and intensity together with maximum intensity and fractional cover as the most relevant metrics. Third, the conifer/hardwood snag classification model utilizing the maximum height, median height, minimum intensity, and area metrics separated snag forest types with an overall accuracy of 84.8\%. Finally, a Gaussian process regression model reliably estimated conifer snag stem diameter (R-2 = 0.81) using height and crown area, thus significantly outperforming regionally calibrated conifer-specific allometric equations. As a result,-80\% of the snag basal area have been mapped. Optimal and potential habitat for Black-backed Woodpecker comprise 53.7 km(2) and 58.4 km(2), respectively, representing 5.1 and 5.6\% of the footprint of the Rim Fire. Our study illustrates the utility of high-density ALS data for characterizing recently burned forests, which, in conjunction with information about the habitat needs of particular snag-dependent wildlife species, can be used to assess habitat characteristics, and thus contribute greatly to forest management and biodiversity conservation.

Such a view reflects one perspective on the general needs (habitat) of species. However, information on the vertical and hori-zontal structure of habitat may play a critical role in defining what a suitable habitat is. The development and application of highly accurate airborne laser scanning (ALS) systems, which are capable of describing the three-dimensional distribution of vegetation, have significant potential value in deriving quantitative relationships between species distributions and their habitat structure. In this paper we review the use of ALS for biodiversity studies, and propose a three-dimensional index which captures the three main com-ponents of vertical and horizontal vegetation structure: height, cover, and complexity. Once developed, we apply the index across the forested area of the Canadian province of Alberta, and compare and con-trast the differences across natural subregions and land cover types. We also demonstrate how the index can be used with biodiversity data, in this case examining patterns in avian species richness. We con-clude with a discussion on the potential use of the habitat structure index with other biodiversity-related research.},

To quantify the influence of different environmental and anthropogenic patterns on observed vegetation patterns, we used simultaneous autoregressive modeling to analyze data collected by the Carnegie Airborne Observatory over Santa Cruz Island (SCI; California, USA). SCI is a large continental island, and its limited suite of species and well documented land use history allowed us to consider many potential determinants of vegetation patterns, such as topography, substrate, and historical grazing intensity. As a metric of vegetation heterogeneity, we used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) stratified into three vegetation height classes using LiDAR (short, medium, and tall). In the SAR models topography and substrate type were important controls, together explaining 8-15 \% of the total variation in NDVI, but historical grazing and spatial autocorrelation were also key components of the models, together explaining 17-21 \% of the variation in NDVI. Optimal spatial autocorrelation distances in the short and medium height vegetation models (600-700 m) were similar to the home range sizes of two crucial seed dispersers on the island-the island fox (Urocyon littoralis santacruzae) and the island scrub-jay (Aphelocoma insularis)-suggesting that these animals may be important drivers of the island's vegetation patterns. This study highlights the importance of dynamic processes like dispersal limitation and disturbance history in determining present-day vegetation patterns.},

Here, we review the current state of avian SDMs and point to challenges and future opportunities for specific applications, ranging from conservation biology, invasive species and predicting seabird distributions, to more general topics such as modeling avian diversity, niche evolution and seasonal distributions at a biogeographic scale. While SDMs have been criticized for being phenomenological in nature, and for their inability to explicitly account for a variety of processes affecting populations, we conclude that they remain a powerful tool to learn about past, current, and future species distributions \textendash{} at least when their limitations and assumptions are recognized and addressed.

  abstract = {Aim: Species distribution modelling, a family of statistical methods that predicts species distributions from a set of occurrences and environmental predictors, is now routinely applied in many macroecological studies. However, the reliability of evaluation metrics usually employed to validate these models remains questioned. Moreover, the emergence of online databases of environmental variables with global coverage, especially climatic, has favoured the use of the same set of standard predictors. Unfortunately, the selection of variables is too rarely based on a careful examination of the species' ecology. In this context, our aim was to highlight the importance of selecting ad hoc variables in species distribution models, and to assess the ability of classical evaluation statistics to identify models with no biological realism. Innovation: First, we reviewed the current practices in the field of species distribution modelling in terms of variable selection and model evaluation. Then, we computed distribution models of 509 European species using pseudo-predictors derived from paintings or using a real set of climatic and topographic predictors. We calculated model performance based on the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and true skill statistics (TSS), partitioning occurrences into training and test data with different levels of spatial independence. Most models computed from pseudo-predictors were classified as good and sometimes were even better evaluated than models computed using real environmental variables. However, on average they were better discriminated when the partitioning of occurrences allowed testing for model transferability. Main conclusions: These findings confirm the crucial importance of variable selection and the inability of current evaluation metrics to assess the biological significance of distribution models. We recommend that researchers carefully select variables according to the species' ecology and evaluate models only according to their capacity to be transfered in distant areas. Nevertheless, statistics of model evaluations must still be interpreted with great caution.},

Understanding these links in cities is complicated by strong but fine-scale differences in habitat structure among green space patches, and a high variance in habitat amount across urban landscapes. 2. We used airborne laser scanning data to disentangle the effects of 3D woody habitat heterogeneity of urban home gardens, and woody habitat amount at four landscape spatial scales (50, 100, 250, and 500 m), on the predation risk of artificial sentinel prey by birds and arthropods. 3. In both predator groups, and at all the investigated spatial scales, cross-scale interactive effects between garden habitat heterogeneity and habitat amount in the urban landscape were the main drivers of predation. Risk of predation by birds was highest in heterogeneous garden habitats, but only in densely built urban landscapes where habitat amount was low to intermediate (10\%-20\%) at large spatial scales (250-500 m). It dropped independently of garden habitat heterogeneity when habitat amount became too low ({$<$}10\%) at small (50-100 m) spatial scales. In contrast, risk of predation by arthropods mostly peaked in homogeneous garden habitats when habitat amount was intermediate (20\%) at large spatial scales. 4. Our findings show that the ability of urban green space patches, such as gardens, to sustain ecosystem functions in cities mainly depends on cross-scale interactive effects with larger scale habitat amount. In birds, predation activity can increase when high patch-scale habitat heterogeneity contrasts with reduced larger scale habitat amount, suggesting concentration effects. Yet, thresholds exist under which ecosystem functioning drops independently of habitat structure. 5. Synthesis and applications. The potential of small-scale interventions to enhance habitat heterogeneity (e.g., by planting native trees with understorey shrubs) for restoring ecosystem functions, such as bird predation, in urban areas is dependent on wider landscape habitat structure. Urban planning should therefore adopt a multiscale approach to sustain and restore ecosystem functions and services; a simple but still not broadly recognized finding. Airborne laser scanning is a useful tool to infer habitat structure across a hierarchy of scales in spatially heterogeneous anthropogenic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Western dry conifer forests continue to experience increased severe, stand-replacing wildfire that is outside of historical precedent. Fuels treatments, landscape-scale modifications of forest fuels and structure, are likely to remain a management tool to modify fire behavior and restore ecological resilience. The impacts of fuels treatments to listed species such as spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) remain uncertain and are contested because of limited available information. To evaluate spotted owl foraging habitat selection in a landscape recently modified by forest fuels-reduction treatments, we radio-marked and tracked 10 California spotted owls (S. o. occidentalis) for 2 years immediately following fuels treatment installation in the northern Sierra Nevada, California, USA. We categorized fuels treatments into 3 types: mechanical thin, installed within the study area as landscape-scale fire breaks characterized by even tree spacing, open understory, and low canopy cover, or group selections; understory thin, a hand-removal of small trees and shrubs; and understory thin followed by underburn, a controlled surface-fuel burn that left the overstory intact. We described post-treatment habitat using forest structural metrics derived from a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) dataset that was collected 1 year after fuels treatments were completed. We collected 436 spotted owl foraging locations during 2 breeding seasons and evaluated breeding season home range size and composition using a resource selection function. We assessed possible contributors to owl foraging patterns by comparing a priori hypotheses in an information-theoretic approach and using randomly generated points that estimated available habitat. Spotted owl breeding season home ranges contained fuels treatments in proportion to their availability on the landscape and averaged 17.1\% treated area. Within the home range, owl foraging locations in the post-treatment landscape were best predicted by lower proportions of gaps than anticipated at random, steeper slopes, and minimized distance from the owl's site center. Our results suggest that moderate to high proportions of gaps, typically a feature of forest fuels reduction and restoration treatments, may reduce the probability of spotted owl foraging.

  abstract = {a b s t r a c t Quantifying species-habitat relationships provides guidance for establishment of recovery standards for endangered species, but research on forest bird habitat has been limited by availability of fine-grained forest structure data across broad extents. New tools for collection of data on forest bird response to fine-grained forest structure provide opportunities to evaluate habitat thresholds for forest birds. We used LiDAR-derived estimates of habitat attributes and resource selection to evaluate foraging habitat thresholds for recovery of the federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Leuconotopicus borealis; RCW) on the Savannah River Site, South Carolina. First, we generated utilization distributions to define habitat use and availability for 30 RCW groups surveyed over a {$>$}4-h period twice per month between April 2013 and March 2015. Next, we used piecewise regression to characterize RCW threshold responses to LiDAR-derived habitat attributes described in the United States Fish and Wildlife Service recovery plan for RCW. Finally, we used resource utilization functions to estimate selection of specific habitat thresh-olds and used the magnitude of selection to prioritize thresholds for conservation. We identified lower and upper thresholds for densities of pines !35.6 cm dbh (22, 65 trees/ha), basal area (BA) of pines !25.4 cm dbh (1.4, 2.2 m 2 /ha), hardwood canopy cover (6, 31\%), and BA of hardwoods 7.6\textendash 22.9 cm dbh (0.4, 6.07 m 2 /ha); we identified three thresholds for density of pines 7.6\textendash 25.4 cm dbh (56, 341, and 401 trees/ha). Selection rankings prioritized foraging habitat with {$<$}6\% hardwood canopy cover (b = 0.254, 95\% CI = 0.172\textendash 0.336), {$<$} 1.2 m 2 /ha BA of hardwoods 7.6\textendash 22.9 cm dbh (b = 0.162, 95\% CI = 0.050\textendash 0.275), !1.4 m 2 /ha BA of pines !25.4 cm dbh (b = 0.055, 95\% CI = 0.022\textendash 0.087), and !22 pines !35.6 cm dbh/ha (b = 0.015, 95\% CI = 0.013\textendash 0.042). We identified habitat thresholds corresponding to open canopy structure, moderate densities of large and medium pines, and sparse hardwood midstory trees. Selection ranks prioritized multiple thresholds below USFWS range-wide recovery thresholds, indicating site-specific management goals may be beneficial for RCW conservation. Fine-grained LiDAR-derived habitat data coupled with GPS-derived habitat use can guide forest bird conservation by identifying the full range of structural conditions associated with threshold responses.},

  abstract = {Habitat heterogeneity has long been recognized as a fundamental variable indicative of species diversity, in terms of both richness and abundance. Satellite remote sensing data sets can be useful for quantifying habitat heterogeneity across a range of spatial scales. Past remote sensing analyses of species diversity have largely been limited to correlative studies based on the use of vegetation indices or derived land cover maps. A relatively new form of laser remote sensing (lidar) provides another means to acquire information on habitat heterogeneity. Here we examine the efficacy of lidar metrics of canopy structural diversity as predictors of bird species richness in the temperate forests of Maryland, USA. Canopy height, topography and the vertical distribution of canopy elements were derived from lidar imagery of the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge and compared to bird survey data collected at referenced grid locations. The canopy vertical distribution information was consistently found to be the strongest predictor of species richness, and this was predicted best when stratified into guilds dominated by forest, scrub, suburban and wetland species. Similar lidar variables were selected as primary predictors across guilds. Generalized linear and additive models, as well as binary hierarchical regression trees produced similar results. The lidar metrics were also consistently better predictors than traditional remotely sensed variables such as canopy cover, indicating that lidar provides a valuable resource for biodiversity research applications. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Recent advances in remote sensing and ecological modeling warrant a timely and robust investigation of the ecological variables that underlie large-scale patterns of breeding bird species richness, particularly in the context of intensifying land use and climate change. Our objective was to address this need using an array of bioclimatic and remotely sensed data sets representing vegetation properties and structure, and other aspects of the physical environment. We first build models of bird species richness across breeding bird survey (BBS) routes, and then spatially predict richness across the coterminous US at moderately high spatial resolution (1 km). Predictor variables were derived from various sources and maps of species richness were generated for four groups (guilds) of birds with different breeding habitat affiliation (forest, grassland, open woodland, scrub/shrub), as well as all guilds combined. Predictions of forest bird distributions were strong (R-2 = 0.85), followed by grassland (0.76), scrub/shrub (0.63) and open woodland (0.60) species. Vegetation properties were generally the strongest determinants of species richness, whereas bioclimatic and lidar-derived vertical structure metrics were of variable importance and dependent upon the guild type. Environmental variables (climate and the physical environment) were also frequently selected predictors, but canopy structure variables were not as important as expected based on more local to regional scale studies. Relatively sparse sampling of canopy structure metrics from the satellite lidar sensor may have reduced their importance relative to other predictor variables across the study domain. We discuss these results in the context of the ecological drivers of species richness patterns, the spatial scale of bird diversity analyses, and the potential of next generation space-borne lidar systems relevant to vegetation and ecosystem studies. This study strengthens current understanding of bird species-climate-vegetation relationships, which could be further advanced with improved canopy structure information across spatial scales.},

ABSTRACT The Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis) is a species of high conservation importance because of its low overall density and long-term widespread population declines on the breeding grounds. Results of previous research on the species suggest that its breeding habitat preferences vary across its range. However, the underlying processes associated with habitat use are unknown. Using a 20 yr dataset, we developed occupancy models for Canada Warblers to determine the influence of habitat characteristics (e.g., understory vegetation, canopy cover), landscape context (e.g., edge, forest patch size), and species co-occurrence on occupancy, colonization, and local extinction parameters. Our results show that multiple habitats are used by Canada Warblers on the breeding grounds; common variables associated with large-scale, long-term occupancy dynamics are forest age, landscape composition at the 100 m and 500 m scales, and mean patch size. Overall, Canada Warblers were nearly twice as persistent in mature forest stands (.80 yr) and large, mixed forest stands. Further, models indicated that species co-occurrence was an important predictor of Canada Warbler occupancy in some cover types. The results of this study increase our understanding of population processes over large, dynamic landscapes and provide essential conservation information to improve habitat and landscape management for the Canada Warbler.},

  abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone. \textcopyright{} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

However, the intensity and persistence of these effects have rarely been documented. We used a before-after, control-impact (BACI) paired design, i.e., five pairs of 25-ha study plots, 1-control and 1-treated plot, to quantify changes in the density of eight forest bird species in response to selection harvesting over six breeding seasons, one year pre- and five years postharvest. Focal species included mature forest associates, i.e., Northern Parula (Setophaga americana) and Black-throated Green Warbler (Setophaga virens), forest generalists, i.e., Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius) and Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), early-seral specialists, i.e., Mourning Warbler (Geothlypis philadelphia) and Chestnut-sided Warbler (Setophaga pensylvanica), species associated with shrubby forest gaps, i.e., Black-throated Blue Warbler (Setophaga caerulescens), and mid-seral species, i.e., American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla). As predicted, we found a negative numerical response to the treatment in the Black-throated Green Warbler, no treatment effect in the Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, and a positive treatment effect in early-seral specialists. We only detected a year effect in the Northern Parula and the American Redstart. There was evidence for a positive treatment effect on the Swainson's Thrush when the regeneration started to reach the pole stage, i.e., fifth year postharvest. These findings suggest that selection harvesting has the potential to maintain diverse avian assemblages while allowing sustainable management of timber supply, but future studies should determine whether mature-forest associates can sustain second-and third-entry selection harvest treatments.},

We evaluated whether density was a useful surrogate of habitat quality for the White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), an apparent habitat generalist, in a recently logged landscape near Calling Lake, Alberta, Canada. We detected significant differences in the territory density of birds among three distinct habitat types: interior forest, forest edges, and recent (4- to 6-yr-old) clear-cuts. However, the observed patterns in territory density were not consistent with several indices of habitat quality. We found a consistent and marked gradient for indices such as nesting success (based on a reproductive index), pairing success, and the proportion of territories that successfully fledged young between interior forest sites and clear-cuts. Edge habitats, in which high relative density offset lower reproductive success, represented moderate-quality habitat for this species. Our results suggest that the continued use of density alone, without some measure of habitat quality, is insufficient if not misleading when evaluating response to habitat change. Our results have important implications for understanding the population dynamics of this species, which is often overlooked in population-level studies yet continues to experience long-term population declines over large portions of its breeding range.},

  abstract = {Building or maintaining corridors in fragmented landscapes may be an important method to conserve gap-sensitive species that avoid crossing gaps in forest cover. We tested the effectiveness of corridors by examining the changes in abundance of boreal birds pre- and post-logging in experimental 10-ha and 40-ha reserves that were isolated or connected by corridors, relative to their abundance responses in continuous forest (reference sites). Prior to the analysis, we categorized birds as to their predicted gap sensitivity based on two measures: their use of corridors and gap-crossing behavior in small-scale trials, and their habitat affinities (forest species vs. habitat generalists). The abundance of forest species as a group was consistently higher in reference reserves than in isolated or connected reserves after harvest, except for the first year, after harvest, when crowding occurred in isolates. Habitat generalist species showed no differences in abundances across reserve types. As a group, resident species were more abundant in reference and connected reserves than in isolates in three of five years post-harvest, suggesting that corridors might benefit these species. None of the single species analyzed showed consistent evidence of benefiting from corridors. Although four species were most abundant in connected reserves after harvest, their abundances were not significantly lower in isolates than in reference sites. Behavioral classification (gap-crossing propensity) was not useful in classifying single species as to how gap sensitive they would be in response to our experiment: habitat affinity was a better predictor. We suggest that corridors may be useful to retain resident birds on harvested landscapes, but that corridors connecting small reserves of forest are unlikely to offset the impacts of fragmentation for most boreal birds. Assessments of the utility of corridors must, however, be done in the context of the full plant and animal communities that live in the boreal forest.},

  abstract = {Globally, seabirds are vulnerable to anthropogenic threats both at sea and on land. Seabirds typically nest colonially and show strong fidelity to natal colonies, and such colonies on low-lying islands may be threatened by sea-level rise. We used French Frigate Shoals, the largest atoll in the Hawaiian Archipelago, as a case study to explore the population dynamics of seabird colonies and the potential effects sea-level rise may have on these rookeries. We compiled historic observations, a 30-year time series of seabird population abundance, lidar-derived elevations, and aerial imagery of all the islands of French Frigate Shoals. To estimate the population dynamics of 8 species of breeding seabirds on Tern Island from 1980 to 2009, we used a Gompertz model with a Bayesian approach to infer population growth rates, density dependence, process variation, and observation error. All species increased in abundance, in a pattern that provided evidence of density dependence. Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor), Masked Boobies (Sula dactylatra), Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda), Spectacled Terns (Onychoprion lunatus), and White Terns (Gygis alba) are likely at carrying capacity. Density dependence may exacerbate the effects of sea-level rise on seabirds because populations near carrying capacity on an island will be more negatively affected than populations with room for growth. We projected 12\% of French Frigate Shoals will be inundated if sea level rises 1 m and 28\% if sea level rises 2 m. Spectacled Terns and shrub-nesting species are especially vulnerable to sea-level rise, but seawalls and habitat restoration may mitigate the effects of sea-level rise. Losses of seabird nesting habitat may be substantial in the Hawaiian Islands by 2100 if sea levels rise 2 m. Restoration of higher-elevation seabird colonies represent a more enduring conservation solution for Pacific seabirds.},

  abstract = {Structure is a fundamental physical element of habitat, particularly in woodlands, and hence there has been considerable recent uptake of airborne lidar data in forest ecology studies. This paper investigates the significance of lidar data characteristics when modelling organism-habitat relationships, taking a single species case study in a mature woodland ecosystem. We re-investigate work on great tit (Parus major) habitat, focussing on bird breeding data from 1997 and 2001 (years with contrasting weather conditions and a demonstrated relationship between breeding success and forest structure). We use a time series of three lidar data acquisitions across a 12-year period (2000-2012). The lidar data characteristics assessed include time-lag with field data (up to 15 years), spatial sampling density (average post spacing in the range of 1 pulse per 0.14 m\textsuperscript{2-}17.77 m\textsuperscript{2}), approach to processing (raster or point cloud), and the complexity of derived structure metrics (with a total of 33 metrics assessed, each generated separately using all returns and only first returns). Ordinary least squares regression analysis was employed to investigate relationships between great tit mean nestling body mass, calculated per brood, and the various canopy structure measures from all lidar datasets. For the 2001 bird breeding data, the relationship between mean nestling body mass and mean canopy height for a sample area around each nest was robust to the extent that it could be detected strongly and with a high level of statistical significance, with relatively little impact of lidar data characteristics. In 1997, all relationships between lidar structure metrics and mean nestling body mass were weaker than in 2001 and more sensitive to lidar data characteristics, and in almost all cases they were opposite in trend. However, whilst the optimum habitat structure differed between the two study years, the lidar-derived metrics that best characterised this structure were consistent: canopy height percentiles and mean overstorey canopy height (calculated using all returns or only first returns) and the standard deviation of canopy height (calculated using all returns). Overall, our results suggest that for relatively stable woodland habitats, ecologists should not feel prohibited in using lidar data to explore or monitor organism-habitat relationships because of perceived data quality issues, as long as the questions investigated, the scale of analysis, and the interpretation of findings are appropriate for the data available.},

Forest mensuration data for the study site were examined to identify thresholds (taking the 95th percentile) for crown depth as a percentage of crown top height for the six overstorey tree species present. These data were used in association with a digital tree species map and leaf-on first return LiDAR data, to identify the possible depth of space available below the overstorey canopy in which an understorey layer could exist. The leaf-off last return LiDAR data were then examined to identify whether they contained information on where this space was occupied by suppressed trees or shrubs forming an understorey. Thus, understorey was mapped from the leaf-off last return data where the height was below the predicted crown depth. A height threshold of 1 m was applied to separate the ground vegetation layer from the understorey. The derived understorey model formed a discontinuous layer covering 46.4 ha (or 31\% of the study site), with an average height of 2.64 m and a 77\% correspondence with field data on the presence/absence of suppressed trees and shrubs (kappa 0.53). Because the first return data in leaf-on and leaf-off conditions were very similar (differing by an average of just 0.87 m), it was also possible to map the understorey layer using leaf-off data alone. The resultant understorey model covered 39.4 ha (or 26\% of the study site), and had a 72\% correspondence with field data on the presence/absence of suppressed trees and shrubs (kappa 0.45). This moderate reduction in the area of understorey mapped and associated accuracy came with a saving of half of all data acquisition and pre-processing costs. Whilst the understorey modelling presented here undoubtedly benefited from the specific timing of LiDAR data acquisition and from ancillary data available for the study site, the conclusions have resonance beyond this case study. Given that the understorey and overstorey canopies in lowland broadleaf woodland can merge into one another, the modelling of understorey information from discrete-return LiDAR data must consider overstorey canopy characteristics and laser penetration through the overstorey. It is not adequate in such circumstances to apply simple height thresholds to LiDAR height frequency distributions, as this is unlikely to distinguish whether a return has backscattered from the lower parts of the overstorey canopy or from near the surface of the understorey canopy.

Red-naped sapsucker ecology within aspen (Populus tremuloides) has been well studied, but relatively little is known about red-naped sapsuckers in conifer for- ests. We used light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to examine occupancy patterns of red-naped sapsuckers in a conifer-dominated system. We surveyed for sapsuckers at 162 sites in northern Idaho, USA, during 2009 and 2010. We used occupancy models and an information-theoretic approach to model sap- sucker occupancy as a function of four LiDAR-based metrics that characterized vegetation structure and tree harvest, and one non-LiDAR metric that charac- terized distance to major roads. We evaluated model support across a range of territory sizes using Akaike's information criterion. Top model support was highest at the 4-ha extent, which suggested that 4 ha was the most relevant scale describing sapsucker occupancy. Sapsuckers were positively associated with variation of canopy height and harvested area, and negatively associated with shrub and large tree density. These results suggest that harvest regimes and structural diversity of vegetation at moderate extents (e.g., 4 ha) largely influ- ence occurrence of red-naped sapsuckers in conifer forests. Given the current and projected declines of aspen populations, it will be increasingly important to assess habitat relationships, as well as demographic characteristics, of aspen- associated species such as red-naped sapsuckers within conifer-dominated sys- tems},

  abstract = {The study of population dynamics and species\textendash habitat interactions is important for many ecological and conservation issues. We analysed the occupancy dynamics of the Wood Warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix, a forest interior passerine that has suffered long-term declines in many European countries. Considering a broad range of habitat descriptors, including LiDAR-based variables characterizing forest structure, we identified environmental factors influencing the probabilities of occupancy, colonization, extinction and detection, and mapped these probabilities at a landscape scale. We used presence\textendash absence data collected between 1999 and 2013 in a robust-design protocol with replicated surveys within each primary sampling season (i.e. breeding season). To analyse occupancy dynamics, we fitted dynamic occupancy models with covariates describing topography, forest extent and structure, soil, seed masting (as a proxy for rodent abundance) and weather conditions during settlement. Initial occupancy was positively related to slope, forest cover and the proportion of broadleaf forest, and negatively related to forest edge length, canopy height variation and soil nutrients. Colonization probability was positively associated with slope and negatively with canopy height variation and soil nutrients. Extinction probability was negatively related to slope, positively related to forest edge length and was lowest at intermediate vegetation heights. Detection probability decreased during the season and was positively related to forest cover. This study provides insights into the settlement dynamics of a declining forest species by identifying potential drivers of the processes underlying occupancy dynamics, instead of simply modelling species abundance or occurrence. Forest-related covariates were of overwhelming importance for the settlement dynamics of the Wood Warbler. Conservation measures should focus on providing and maintaining the species' preferred forest structure, specifically in extended forests. In Switzerland, forests located on slopes and on nutrient-poor soils should be prioritized for conservation. Finally, comparing findings derived from the relatively coarse scale of this study with those from the small scale of individual territories suggests that conservation recommendations deduced from large-scale monitoring schemes alone may be incomplete, and vice versa.},

In birds, despite recent advances in tracking techniques, knowledge of habitat needs remains incomplete for most species. Using radio telemetry, we quantified the relative space use of 37 Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) males, captured over 2 years (2013, 2014) on their breeding grounds in coastal Virginia. Following tracking, we collected data on prey availability (n = 370 plots) and habitat structure (n = 222 plots) within bird home ranges, and modeled bird utilization distribution with both sets of variables using mixed models. Our objectives were to (a) determine the relative importance of habitat structure and prey availability for bird use, (b) identify specific resources that related to bird utilization distribution, (c) test the hypothesis that soil moisture explained prey availability, and (d) evaluate models by determining whether model-identified conditions agreed with data at sites where Wood Thrushes were absent over the preceding 5 years. Of prey variables, high-use areas within bird home ranges were linked to higher biomass of spiders and worm-like invertebrates, which were strongly correlated with soil moisture. Of habitat structure variables, bird use related negatively to red oak (Quercus spp.) count and pine (Pinus spp.) basal area, and positively to forest canopy height, snag basal area, and number and species richness of trees, among others. Evaluation of 12 covariates in our best model revealed that 5 were significant, with conditions at bird absence sites congruent with our models. Goodness-of-fit tests revealed poor fit of the prey-only model, whereas the habitat-only model explained nearly 8 times the variation in bird use. The model utilizing both prey and structure covariates yielded only marginal improvement over the habitat-only model. Consequently, management objectives aimed at habitat improvement for the declining Wood Thrush should particularly consider habitat structure resources.},

Conservation professionals can choose from a considerable number of modelling techniques, but there has been relatively little evaluation of predictive performance, data requirements, or type of inference of these models. Empirical data for woodland caribou Rangifier tarandus caribou was used to examine four species distribution models, namely a qualitative habitat suitability index and quantitative resource selection function, Mahalanobis distance and ecological niche models. Models for three sets of independent variables were developed and then a temporally independent set of caribou locations evaluated predictive performance. The similarity of species distribution maps among the four modelling approaches was also quantified. All of the quantitative species distribution models were good predictors of the validation data set, but the spatial distribution of mapped habitats differed considerably among models. These results suggest that choice of model and variable set could influence the identification of areas for conservation emphasis. Model choice may be limited by the type of species locations or desired inference. Conservation professionals should choose a model and variable set based on the question, the ecology of the species and the availability of requisite data.},

Seven sets of LiDAR metrics were tested to measure canopy structure.

These results suggest that LiDAR can accurately characterize forest successional stage where field measurements are not available.

However, there are virtually no longitudinal studies that have assessed long-term effects of forest harvesting on boreal birds.

We have 24 years of avian point count data (1993\textendash 2016) from this study site, giving us the opportunity to study how the boreal songbird community has responded over 23 years to forest regeneration after harvesting. We ran multi-season occupancy models of 51 species surveyed at 72 stations (8 stations per 40-ha sampling area) within 3 unharvested forest sites, 3 harvest units that were cut in 1984 and treated to enhance conifer survival, and 3 harvest units that were cut in 1994 and left untreated to regenerate naturally. Eight of 21 species associated with older boreal forests ({$\geq$}60\textendash 80 years old) used harvest units 23\textendash 33 years post-harvest. Eleven of 16 species associated with shrublands or younger forests used harvest units, before declining as harvest units regenerated, while four of 16 such species increased their probability of occupying harvest units over the monitoring period. Increased occupancy by 5 Neotropical migrants and 2 short-distance migrants was associated with increased El Nino weather events preceding a given breeding season. We also found evidence that increased occupancy of 3 species within harvest units was preceded by and correlated with increased occupancy by those species in unharvested forests, while occupancy of 4 species in unharvested forests was preceded by and correlated with increased occupancy within harvest units. Our results indicate the importance of unharvested forests for some boreal songbird species, the utility of longitudinal studies with controls for assessing changes in occupancy due to forest regeneration in harvest units versus factors operating at larger spatial scales, and the potential of harvest units to serve as habitat for boreal birds up to 33 years post-harvest.},

The GAP land-cover designations are based on satellite-derived data, and although these data are widely available, these data do not capture the 3-dimensional vegetation architecture that may be important in describing vertebrate distributions. To date, no studies have examined how the inclusion of snag-or shrub-specific Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data might influence GAP model performance. The objectives of this paper were 1) to assess the performance of the National GAP models and Northwest GAP models with independently collected field data, and 2) to assess whether the inclusion of 3-dimensional vegetation data from LiDAR improved the performance of National GAP and Northwest GAP models. We included only two parameters from the LiDAR data: presence or absence of shrubs and presence or absence of snags {$>$}= 25 cm diameter at breast height. We surveyed for birds at {$>$}150 points in a 20,000-ha coniferous forest in northern Idaho and used data for eight shrub-and cavity-nesting species for validation purposes. On a guild level, National GAP models performed only marginally better than Northwest GAP models in correct classification rate, and LiDAR data did not improve vertebrate distribution models. At the scale used in this study, GAP models had poor predictive power and this is important for managers interested in using GAP models for species distributions at scales similar to ours, such as a small park or preserve,200 km(2) in size. Additionally, because the inclusion of LiDAR data did not consistently affect the performance of GAP models, future studies might consider whether LiDAR data affect GAP model performance by examining 1) different spatial scales, 2) different LiDAR metrics, and/or 3) species-specific habitat relationships not currently available in GAP models.},

Predictive models based on underpinning relationships between environmental predictors and the individual organism are likely to require measurement of spatially fine-grained predictor variables. Further, models must show spatial generality if they are to be used to predict the consequences of habitat change over large geographical areas. Remote sensing techniques using airborne scanning laser altimetry (LiDAR) and high resolution multi-spectral imagery allow spatially fine-grained predictor variables to be measured over large geographical areas and thus facilitate testing of the spatial generality of organism-habitat models. These techniques are considered using the skylark as an example species. A range image segmentation system for LiDAR data is described which allows measurement of skylark habitat predictor variables such as within-field vegetation height, boundary height and shape for individual fields within the LiDAR image. Additional variables such as field vegetation type and fractional vegetation ground cover may be obtained from co-registered multi-spectral data. These techniques could have wide application in testing the generality of relationships between populations and habitats, and in ecological monitoring of change in habitat structures and the associated effects on wildlife, over large geographical areas.},

We test the performance of a model frequently used and heavily relied-upon for the man-agement of the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis). The RCW Foraging Matrix Application incorporates spatially-explicit forest stand data and woodpecker territory locations to pro-duce quantitative assessments of foraging habitat quality. Model parameters were based on expert opin-ion and research performed on several key populations at a time when range-wide habitat quality was relatively poor. Since the model's inception, many red-cockaded woodpecker populations have been monitored intensely in restored habitat, providing an opportunity to evaluate model performance range-wide. We assessed the relationship of habitat quality, as measured by the RCW Matrix Application, to group size and fledgling production from populations across the species range in the southeastern Uni-ted States. We also evaluated foraging habitat quality directly by relating woodpecker fitness compo-nents to foraging habitat metrics through regression tree analyses. Results showed that some, but not all, of the habitat metrics included in the RCW Matrix Application were consistently related to fitness components range-wide, but threshold values for these habitat metrics identified by regression tree anal-yses were site-specific rather than universal.

  abstract = {Whether diversity and composition of avian communities is determined primarily by responses of species to the floristic composition or to the structural characteristics of habitats has been an ongoing debate, at least since the publication of MacArthur and MacArthur (1961). This debate, however, has been hampered by two problems: 1) it is notoriously time consuming to measure the physiognomy of habitat, particularly in forests, and 2) rigorous statistical methods to predict the composition of bird assemblages from assemblages of plants have not been available. Here we use airborne laser scanning (lidar) to measure the habitat (vegetation) structure of a montane forest across large spatial extents with a very fine grain. Furthermore, we use predictive co-correspondence and canonical correspondence analyses to predict the composition of bird communities from the composition and structure of another community (i.e. plants). By using these new techniques, we show that the physiognomy of the vegetation is a significantly more powerful predictor of the composition of bird assemblages than plant species composition in the field and as well in the shrub/tree layer, both on a level of p{$<$}0.001. Our results demonstrate that ecologists should consider remote sensing as a tool to improve the understanding of the variation of bird assemblages in space and time. Particularly in complex habitats, such as forests, lidar is a valuable and comparatively inexpensive tool to characterize the structure of the canopy even across large and rough terrain.

In the range of the spotted owl, these treatments may reduce canopy cover and tree density, which could reduce preferred habitat conditions for the owl and other sensitive species. In particular, high canopy cover ({$>$}= 70\%) has been widely reported to be an important feature of spotted owl habitat, but averages of stand-level forest cover do not provide important information on foliage height and gap structure. To provide better quantification of canopy structure, we used airborne LiDAR imagery to identify canopy cover in different height strata and the size and frequency of gaps that were associated with owl nest sites, protected activity centers (PACs), and territories within four study areas and 316 owl territories. Although total canopy cover was high in nest stands and PAC areas, the cover in tall ( {$>$} 48 m) trees was the canopy structure most highly selected for, while cover in lower strata (2-16 m) was avoided compared to availability in the surrounding landscape. Tall tree cover gradually decreased and lower strata cover increased as distance increased from the nest. Large ( {$>$} 1000 m(2)) gaps were not found near nests, but otherwise there was no difference in gap frequencies and sizes between PACs and territories and the surrounding landscape. Using cluster analysis we classified canopy conditions into 5 structural classes and 4 levels of canopy cover to assess the relationship between total canopy cover and tree size within nest sites, PACs, and territories. High canopy cover ({$>$}= 70\%) mostly occurs when large tree cover is high, indicating the two variables are often confounded. Our results suggest that the cover of tall trees may be a better predictor of owl habitat than total canopy cover because the latter can include cover in the 2-16 m strata - conditions that owls actually avoid. Management strategies designed to preserve and facilitate the growth of tall trees while reducing the cover and density of understory trees may improve forest resilience to drought and wildfire while also maintaining or promoting the characteristics of owl habitat.}

We studied the effect of habitat fragmentation on the richness, diversity, turnover, and abundance of breeding bird communities in old, boreal mixed-wood forest by creating isolated and connected forest fragments of 1, 10, 40, and 100 ha. Connected fragments were linked by 100 m wide riparian buffer strips. Each size class within treatments and controls was replicated three times. We sampled the passerine community using point counts before, and in each of two years after, forest harvesting, accumulating 21 340 records representing 59 species. We detected no significant change in species richness as a result of the harvesting, except in the 1-ha connected fragments, where the number of species increased two years after isolation. This increase was accounted for by transient species, suggesting that the adjacent buffer strips were being used as movement corridors. Diversity (log series alpha index) was dependent on area in the isolated fragments only after cutting, having decreased in the smaller areas. Turnover rates in the isolated fragments were sig-nificantly higher than in similar connected or control areas, due to species replacement. Crowding occurred in the isolated fragments immediately after cutting, but two years after fragmentation, the responses in abundance of species varied with migratory strategy. Num-bers of Neotropical migrants declined in both connected and isolated fragments, and resident species declined in isolated fragments. Most species in these groups require older forest, many favoring interior areas. Abundance of short-distance migrants, most of which are habitat generalists, did not change. Overall, although there was no decrease in species richness from our recently fragmented areas, community structure was altered; maintaining connections between fragments helped to mitigate these effects. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the fragmentation effects we documented is small compared with those observed else-where. Birds breeding in the boreal forest, where frequent small-and large-scale natural disturbances have occurred historically, may be more resilient to human-induced habitat changes, such as those caused by forest harvesting. However, these results should be in-terpreted with caution. First, they are short-term and address only broad-scale community responses based on species richness and relative abundance. Second, the study area was embedded in a landscape where large areas of old, mixed forest are still available, potentially dampening any local-scale impacts of fragmentation.},

Methods We used forest inventory and avian survey data to classify 53 species by seral-stage affinity and applied these to generate alternative projections of changes in species' core habitat distributions based on different vegetation lag-time assumptions.

We evaluated the sensitivity of land rankings to seral-stage affinity and species' weights and assessed the conservation value of the existing protected areas network compared to Zonation results. Results End-of-century projected changes in songbird distribution were reduced by up to 169\% when vegetation lags were considered. Zonation land rankings based on unconstrained climate projections were concentrated at high latitudes, whereas those based on strict and modified refugia scenarios were concentrated in coastal and high-elevation areas, as well as biome transition zones, which were fairly consistent over time and species weights.

  abstract = {In this study we evaluate nest site and habitat preferences of Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio) in the national park Mols Bjerge, Denmark. In total, 28 nests were found during 2010 and 2011. To determine nesting site preferences, the species composition of vegetation in scrub used for nesting was compared to that of nearest unused scrub. To evaluate habitat preferences, a Resource Selection Probability Function (RSPF) was modelled based on presence/absence data. The habitat factors were represented by Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) derived measures of vegetation height and topographic wetness as well as distance to nearest road/path, as an indicator of human disturbance. Scrub used as nesting sites were characterized by thorny shrub species such as Prunus spinosa and Rubus fruticosus. RSPF showed that shrike presence was positively correlated with vegetation heterogeneity and high topographic wetness, and that it was unaffected by the distance to the nearest road/path. These results provide some guidelines for management, showing that Red-backed Shrike for nesting preferred habitats with high wetness, possibly linked to food availability, and heterogeneous vegetation, consistent with their need for low vegetation for hunting and higher vegetation for hunting perches and nest sites, with thorny shrubs especially important for the latter.},

Travel between breeding and wintering regions poses a signifi cant energetic and navigational challenge to birds, although it is not clear how these movements infl uence breeding dispersal and range expansion. Here I ask whether the possible costs of migration limit the breeding ranges of wood warblers, a group of birds with an extensive history of ecological and evolutionary studies. I used occurrence records for multiple wood warbler species, breeding primarily in the boreal forest of North America, to generate environmental niche models. I tested for over-prediction of habitat suitability into the western boreal forest, where most these species do not have occurrence records but where there is presumably suitable habitat. I found that some of these vagile taxa, primarily found east of the Rocky Mountains, also have predicted habitat suitability that extends into the north and west, where they have little to no occurrence records. I discuss several possible explanations for this discordance. In particular, the patterns are consistent with the costs of a long-distance migration limiting the benefi ts of range expansion, as migration may become too onerous as the distance between breeding and wintering areas increases. Th ese results speak to the process of niche fi lling more generally and call attention to an under-appreciated explanation for why migratory species may not fully occupy their fundamental niche.},

  abstract = {Vegetation structure quantified by light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can improve understanding of wildlife occupancy and species-richness patterns. However, there is often a time lag between the collection of LiDAR data and wildlife data. We investigated whether a time lag between the LiDAR acquisition and field-data acquisition affected mapped wildlife distributions ranging from an individual species distribution to total avian species richness in a conifer forest. We collected bird and LiDAR data in 2009 across a 20,000ha forest in northern Idaho. Using the 2009 LiDAR data, we modelled the probability of occurrence for the brown creeper (Certhia americana). Using the same 2009 LiDAR data, we additionally modelled total avian species richness and richness of three different bird nesting guilds (ground/understory, mid/upper canopy and cavity). We mapped brown creeper occupancy probability and species richness using the 2009 models, and then compared these maps with maps based on the same models applied to a 2003-LiDAR dataset. A prior study identified areas harvested between 2003 and 2009. There was on average a 5\% absolute decrease in mapped probabilities of brown creeper occurrence in non-harvest areas between 2003 and 2009. Species richness changed by less than one species in all cases within non-harvest areas between the 2003 and 2009 maps. Although these comparisons were statistically significant at the p{$<$}0.0001 level, it is likely that the high number of map cells (similar to 480,000) influenced this result. Similar patterns between our 2003 and 2009 maps in non-harvest areas for this suite of avian responses suggests that a 6-year difference between field-data collection and LiDAR-data collection has a minimal effect on mapped avian patterns in an undisturbed coniferous forest. However, because this is one case study in one ecosystem, additional work examining the effect of temporal lags between LiDAR and field-data collection on mapping wildlife distributions is warranted in additional ecosystems.},

Tools that can characterize their distributions along with other features important as wildlife habitat, such as woody shrub cover, would be useful for research and management purposes. Three dimensional lidar data and Landsat time series disturbance products have both shown varying promise in their ability to characterize aspects of dead biomass and understory cover, but studies exploring the combination of the remote sensing datasets calibrated with field data to model difficult to map habitat components are limited. The purpose of this study was to 1) relate lidar and Landsat time series products to field collected calibration data to produce maps of important post-fire wildlife habitat components including snags of varying sizes and the availability of a woody shrub layer; and 2) compare the individual performance of the Landsat and lidar datasets for predicting the distributions of these difficult to map forest habitat features Using 164 field calibration plots and remote sensing predictors, we modeled and mapped the distributions of our response variables including snag classes (dbh {$>$}= 40 cm; {$>$}= 50 cm, and {$>$}= 75 cm) and woody shrub cover thresholds ({$>$}= 30 and {$>$}= 50\% cover) at 10 m resolutions. Remote sensing predictors included various lidar structure and topography variables and Landsat time series products representing the pre-fire forest, disturbance magnitude, and current forest condition. A model was chosen for mapping purposes using AIC model selection and then by comparing leave-one-out-cross-validation error matrices to choose among competing models. We were able to predict and map all response variables with moderate accuracies and variable sensitivity (true positive) and specificity (true negative) rates. All snag and shrub models were considered to have ``good\{''\} predictive performance as indicated by area under the curve values (0.74-0.91), with percent correctly classified values ranging from 69-85\% when a probability threshold is chosen that balances false positive and false negative errors. Landsat models performed marginally better than lidar structure models according to classification statistics. Landsat-only models had slightly less accuracy than models that included lidar and Landsat data, but often with greater errors than the combined model. The ability to map the response variables with moderate errors and acceptable accuracies for many applications was through the fusion of these remote sensing datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to model and map Lewis's woodpecker nesting habitat using primary (directly derived) and secondary (modeled using ground calibration data) remote sensing products, as well as contribute to the knowledge of nesting ecology for the species in a source habitat type.

Our selected model had a percent correctly classified rate of 83.3\% and contained additional variables (variability in canopy cover and topographic slope) to those included in the Fish and Wildlife Service habitat suitability model (HSM) for the species (canopy cover, shrub cover, and density of large snags). We were able to apply the remote sensing products to map realized habitat relationships for this species of conservation concern in an identified source habitat type, providing a potential resource for local scale conservation and management efforts and adding to the regional knowledge of habitat selection for the Lewis's woodpecker.},

Positive heterogeneity-diversity relationships have been found for most studies investigating animal taxa, although negative relationships also occur and the scale dependence of heterogeneity-diversity relationships is little known. We investigated multi-scale, heterogeneity-diversity relationships for bird communities in a semi-arid riparian landscape, using airborne LiDAR data to derive key measures of structural habitat complexity. Habitat heterogeneity-diversity relationships were generally positive, although the overall strength of relationships varied across avian life history guilds (R2 range: 0.03-0.41). Best predicted were the species richness indices of cavity nesters, habitat generalists, woodland specialists, and foliage foragers. Heterogeneity-diversity relationships were also strongly scale-dependent, with strongest associations at the 200-m scale (4ha) and weakest associations at the 50-m scale (0.25ha). Our results underscore the value of LiDAR data for fine-grained quantification of habitat structure, as well as the need for biodiversity studies to incorporate variation among life-history guilds and to simultaneously consider multiple guild functional types (e.g. nesting, foraging, habitat). Results suggest that certain life-history guilds (foliage foragers, cavity nesters, woodland specialists) are more susceptible than others (ground foragers, ground nesters, low nesters) to experiencing declines in local species richness if functional elements of habitat heterogeneity are lost. Positive heterogeneity-diversity relationships imply that riparian conservation efforts need to not only provide high-quality riparian habitat locally, but also to provide habitat heterogeneity across multiple scales. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

  abstract = {Identifying suitable habitat is critical to endangered species management and recovery. However, this basic task is often complicated by the rarity of the species in question and the limited availability of high quality environmental data. The endangered Black-capped Vireo (Vireo atricapilla) occupies early seral shrub communities generated by fire. The ability to predict vegetation structure is particularly important for mapping vireo habitat because this species occupies transitional, non-equilibrium vegetation types. We use presence data for territorial male vireos collected throughout the Fort Hood Military Reservation, Texas, to construct habitat suitability models using vegetation type (mapped from aerial imagery), soil data, and laser altimetry (LiDAR)-derived measures of vegetation structure. LiDAR produces a three-dimensional, high-resolution representation of vegetation structure across broad spatial scales. We built models that incorporated LIDAR outputs as well as the other habitat predictors using a non-parametric machine-learning algorithm, cforest. Models built using a single predictor class (vegetation structure or type or soil) performed similarly across 25 bootstrapped training and test datasets (median accuracies 76\%, 74\%, and 79\%, respectively). Models incorporating two predictor classes performed better (80-81\%) and only slightly worse than the full model (82\%). Furthermore, vegetation type and soil data were more important predictors of habitat suitability than structural measures in the full model. Predictive maps suggest that models incorporating vegetation type and soil would be most useful for habitat conservation and management applications on Fort Hood. The addition of LiDAR-derived variables to the model further distinguishes suitable habitats from potentially suitable but presently overgrown areas. In the absence of detailed vegetation data, models based on structural measures performed well when combined with soil data. This could be useful in a broader regional context in which vireos occupy a greater variety of vegetation types with a common structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, detailed data about forest habitat characteristics across large areas are often incomplete due to difficulties associated with field sampling methods. To overcome this limitation we employed a nationally available light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing dataset to develop variables describing forest landscape structure across a large environmental gradient in Switzerland. Using a model species indicative of structurally rich mountain forests (hazel grouse Bonasa bonasia), we tested the potential of such variables to predict species occurrence and evaluated the additional benefit of LiDAR data when used in combination with traditional, sample plot-based field variables. We calibrated boosted regression trees (BRT) models for both variable sets separately and in combination, and compared the models' accuracies. While both field-based and LiDAR models performed well, combining the two data sources improved the accuracy of the species' habitat model. The variables retained from the two datasets held different types of information: field variables mostly quantified food resources and cover in the field and shrub layer, LiDAR variables characterized heterogeneity of vegetation structure which correlated with field variables describing the understory and ground vegetation. When combined with data on forest vegetation composition from field surveys, LiDAR provides valuable complementary information for encompassing species niches more comprehensively. Thus, LiDAR bridges the gap between precise, locally restricted field-data and coarse digital land cover information by reliably identifying habitat structure and quality across large areas.},

  abstract = {Along with plant species composition forest structural complexity is an important determinant of forest biodiversity, but difficult to predict in space from field data. We analyzed forest structural complexity based on a comprehensive set of variables derived from nationally available, area-wide remote sensing, particularly LiDAR data. We generated variables related to vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneity, as well as site factors potentially indicating the abundance of weakened trees or snags. We used them to predict the occurrence of four bird species with narrow and complementary structural habitat requirements, together being indicative of structurally diverse forests. Presence/absence data of Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), Hazel Grouse (Bonasa bonasia), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) and Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) from three biogeographic mountain regions in Switzerland were used to calibrate species distribution models (boosted regression trees BRT) for each species individually, as well as for the sympatric occurrence of at least three of the four target species. The predictive deviances explained and the AUC values obtained from cross-validation ranged from 15.5\% to 63.1\% and 0.77\% to 0.97\% respectively. Sympatric species occurrence reflecting overall forest structural complexity was predicted best, with an outstanding accuracy. To support management and monitoring schemes we identified variable threshold effects based on partial dependence plots. Variables related to vertical foliage distributions were most important, followed by horizontal structural attributes such as canopy height variations, forest edges and gaps. Site factors such as topographic position improved all models and were most important for the species depending on weakened trees and dead wood. We conclude that recent advances in remote sensing allow for large-scale determination of forest structural characteristics suitable for developing species and habitat distribution models of considerable generality, while keeping an unprecedented level of detail. Our approach allows forest managers to amend regional and countrywide management plans with reliable maps depicting areas of high forest structural complexity and habitat quality, which will facilitate the integration of conservation-relevant information into multifunctional forestry. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We combined airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with color-infrared (CIR) aerial imagery for identifying individual tree characteristics and quantifying multi-scale habitat requirements using the example of the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) (TTW) in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany). This bird, a keystone species of boreal and mountainous forests, is highly reliant on bark beetles dwelling in dead or dying trees. While previous studies showed a positive relationship between the TTW presence and the amount of deadwood as a limiting resource, we hypothesized a unimodal response with a negative effect of very high deadwood amounts and tested for effects of substrate quality. Based on 104 woodpecker presence or absence locations, habitat selection was modelled at four spatial scales reflecting different woodpecker home range sizes. The abundance of standing dead trees was the most important predictor, with an increase in the probability of TTW occurrence up to a threshold of 44-50 dead trees per hectare, followed by a decrease in the probability of occurrence. A positive relationship with the deadwood crown size indicated the importance of fresh deadwood. Remote sensing data allowed both an area-wide prediction of species occurrence and the derivation of ecological threshold values for deadwood quality and quantity for more informed conservation management.},
