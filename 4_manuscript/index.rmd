abstract: The growing availability of regional bird monitoring and remote sensing data provides new opportunities to study how birds respond to forestry by enabling the study of large numbers of harvest blocks over wide spatial extents and providing novel covariates related to the structure and recovery of harvests. We explored the viability of combining LiDAR and optical remote sensing to predict bird response to harvesting. Point count data were gathered from harvest blocks across northern Alberta. We used linear and generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the power of classified habitat data, LiDAR, and Landsat spectral change metrics to predict bird abundance and community response to harvesting. We found LiDAR height and complexity metrics and spectral measures of harvest severity were more predictive of species abundance and diversity than the discrete vegetation and harvest severity classes often used to model birds. Supplementing forest resource inventory data with LiDAR and Landsat time-series can improve the accuracy of bird models while avoiding the costs of ground-based vegetation surveys.
