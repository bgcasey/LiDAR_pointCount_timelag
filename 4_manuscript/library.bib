	abstract = {Light detection and ranging (lidar) is a useful tool for measuring three-dimensional habitat structure; hence, its use in habitat suitability models has been explored, both as a single resource and in combination with other remote-sensing techniques. Here, we evaluated the suitability of airborne lidar data in comparison with aerial photographs and field surveys for modelling the distribution of an endangered and cryptic forest species, the hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia). The study was conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park of southeast Germany. Subsequently, a prediction map for conservation planning was generated for a large area, which encompassed the National Park. We examined the utility of lidar data for generating a hazel grouse distribution model by using machine learning (boosted regression trees), and then compared the results to variables derived from field surveys and aerial photographs, both separately and in combination. The cross-validated discrimination ability of the model was slightly higher when using lidar data (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), 0.79) compared to models using aerial photographs (AUC, 0.75) or field survey data (AUC, 0.78). The predictive performance consistently increased when combining the predictors from different sources, with an AUC of 0.86 being produced in the model combining all three data sources. The three data sources complemented one another, with each data source probably having an advantage at deriving one of three key aspects of the hazel grouse habitat, namely, vertically well-structured forest stands, horizontally mixed successional vegetation stages, and certain deciduous trees as food resources such as mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia). In addition, the diverse lidar metrics might be applied to simultaneously characterize vertically and horizontally well-structured forest stands.We conclude that public available airborne lidar data are a viable source for creating habitat suitability maps for large areas and may have increased utility for detecting forest characteristics and valuable wildlife habitats.},

	abstract = {Direct and indirect effects of disturbance may cause the decline of specialist species and alter the condition of ecological communities. We characterized the community structure and niche characteristics (niche position, marginality, breadth) of upland and lowland boreal birds at scales relevant to both natural and human disturbance patterns in western boreal forests undergoing rapid and extensive multi-sector resource development. Our goal was to identify the degree of ecological specialization in order to inform activities directed at conserving a diversity of species (e.g. specialists and generalists) within the western boreal bird community. We used avian data ({\textgreater}5,220 point counts) and environmental variable data comprised of forest composition, stand, and landscape pattern metrics at local (7.1. ha), landscape (1,963. ha), and regional (11,310. ha) scales to determine boreal bird distribution and community-level associations using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and Outlying Mean Index (OMI) analysis. OMI analysis explained a high proportion of variance in the dataset (71.8\%) and separated boreal birds along two axes associated with moisture-productivity and age-structural complexity gradients. Niche position was influenced by local scale variables (height, age, area of mature-old forest, area of wet soil types), but also landscape and regional scale variables (total area of hardwood and conifer, mean nearest neighbour distance of conifer, and total core area of productive upland conifer). Only 15 of 67 species (22\%) had marginal (atypical) niches and narrow niche breadths exhibiting specialization in old hardwood and white spruce forests and burned, open, and lowland habitats. Most species occupied typical or common habitats within the study area and exhibited generalist strategies typical of species in heterogeneous and disturbed habitats that undergo frequent change. Our results suggest the need to design and implement multi-species plans to conserve a diversity of western boreal bird species (e.g. specialists and generalists) at the regional scale.},

ABSTRACT The Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis) is a species of high conservation importance because of its low overall density and long-term widespread population declines on the breeding grounds. Results of previous research on the species suggest that its breeding habitat preferences vary across its range. However, the underlying processes associated with habitat use are unknown. Using a 20 yr dataset, we developed occupancy models for Canada Warblers to determine the influence of habitat characteristics (e.g., understory vegetation, canopy cover), landscape context (e.g., edge, forest patch size), and species co-occurrence on occupancy, colonization, and local extinction parameters. Our results show that multiple habitats are used by Canada Warblers on the breeding grounds; common variables associated with large-scale, long-term occupancy dynamics are forest age, landscape composition at the 100 m and 500 m scales, and mean patch size. Overall, Canada Warblers were nearly twice as persistent in mature forest stands (.80 yr) and large, mixed forest stands. Further, models indicated that species co-occurrence was an important predictor of Canada Warbler occupancy in some cover types. The results of this study increase our understanding of population processes over large, dynamic landscapes and provide essential conservation information to improve habitat and landscape management for the Canada Warbler.},

We examined whether LiDAR data could be used to directly assess the successional stage of forests by determining the degree to which the LiDAR data would show the same relative ranking of structural development among sites as would traditional field measurements. We sampled 94 primary and secondary sites (19-93,223-350, and 600 years old) from three conifer forest zones in western Washington state, USA, in the field and with small-footprint, discrete return LiDAR. Seven sets of LiDAR metrics were tested to measure canopy structure. Ordinations using the of LiDAR 95th percentile height, rumple, and canopy density metrics had the strongest correlations with ordinations using two sets of field metrics (Procrustes R = 0.72 and 0.78) and a combined ser of LiDAR and field metrics (Procrustes R = 0.95). These results suggest that LiDAR can accurately characterize forest successional stage where field measurements are not available. This has important implications for enabling basic and applied studies of forest structure at stand to landscape scales.},

	abstract = {Many observational and short-term experimental studies have examined how boreal bird communities respond to forest harvesting. However, there are virtually no longitudinal studies that have assessed long-term effects of forest harvesting on boreal birds. The Calling Lake Fragmentation Study is a long-term experiment in northern Alberta’s boreal forest, established in 1993. We have 24 years of avian point count data (1993–2016) from this study site, giving us the opportunity to study how the boreal songbird community has responded over 23 years to forest regeneration after harvesting. We ran multi-season occupancy models of 51 species surveyed at 72 stations (8 stations per 40-ha sampling area) within 3 unharvested forest sites, 3 harvest units that were cut in 1984 and treated to enhance conifer survival, and 3 harvest units that were cut in 1994 and left untreated to regenerate naturally. Eight of 21 species associated with older boreal forests (≥60–80 years old) used harvest units 23–33 years post-harvest. Eleven of 16 species associated with shrublands or younger forests used harvest units, before declining as harvest units regenerated, while four of 16 such species increased their probability of occupying harvest units over the monitoring period. Increased occupancy by 5 Neotropical migrants and 2 short-distance migrants was associated with increased El Nino weather events preceding a given breeding season. We also found evidence that increased occupancy of 3 species within harvest units was preceded by and correlated with increased occupancy by those species in unharvested forests, while occupancy of 4 species in unharvested forests was preceded by and correlated with increased occupancy within harvest units. Our results indicate the importance of unharvested forests for some boreal songbird species, the utility of longitudinal studies with controls for assessing changes in occupancy due to forest regeneration in harvest units versus factors operating at larger spatial scales, and the potential of harvest units to serve as habitat for boreal birds up to 33 years post-harvest.},

	abstract = {Structure is a fundamental physical element of habitat, particularly in woodlands, and hence there has been considerable recent uptake of airborne lidar data in forest ecology studies. This paper investigates the significance of lidar data characteristics when modelling organism-habitat relationships, taking a single species case study in a mature woodland ecosystem. We re-investigate work on great tit (Parus major) habitat, focussing on bird breeding data from 1997 and 2001 (years with contrasting weather conditions and a demonstrated relationship between breeding success and forest structure). We use a time series of three lidar data acquisitions across a 12-year period (2000-2012). The lidar data characteristics assessed include time-lag with field data (up to 15 years), spatial sampling density (average post spacing in the range of 1 pulse per 0.14 m$^{\textrm{2-}}$17.77 m$^{\textrm{2}}$), approach to processing (raster or point cloud), and the complexity of derived structure metrics (with a total of 33 metrics assessed, each generated separately using all returns and only first returns). Ordinary least squares regression analysis was employed to investigate relationships between great tit mean nestling body mass, calculated per brood, and the various canopy structure measures from all lidar datasets. For the 2001 bird breeding data, the relationship between mean nestling body mass and mean canopy height for a sample area around each nest was robust to the extent that it could be detected strongly and with a high level of statistical significance, with relatively little impact of lidar data characteristics. In 1997, all relationships between lidar structure metrics and mean nestling body mass were weaker than in 2001 and more sensitive to lidar data characteristics, and in almost all cases they were opposite in trend. However, whilst the optimum habitat structure differed between the two study years, the lidar-derived metrics that best characterised this structure were consistent: canopy height percentiles and mean overstorey canopy height (calculated using all returns or only first returns) and the standard deviation of canopy height (calculated using all returns). Overall, our results suggest that for relatively stable woodland habitats, ecologists should not feel prohibited in using lidar data to explore or monitor organism-habitat relationships because of perceived data quality issues, as long as the questions investigated, the scale of analysis, and the interpretation of findings are appropriate for the data available.},

	abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Species are characterized by physiological, behavioral, and ecological attributes that are all subject to varying evolutionary and ecological constraints and jointly detemrine species' role and function in ecosystems. Attributes such as diet, foraging strata, foraging time, and body size, in particular, characterize a large portion of the "Eltonian" niches of species. Here we present a global species-level compilation of these key attributes for all 9993 and 5400 extant bird and mammal species derived from key literature sources. Global handbooks and monographs allowed the consistent sourcing of attributes for most species. For diet and foraging stratum we followed a defined protocol to translate the verbal descriptions into standardized, semiquantitative information about relative importance of different categories. Together with body size (continuous) and activity time (categorical) this enables a much finer distinction of species' foraging ecology than typical categorical guild assignments allow. Attributes lacking information for specific species are flagged, and interpolated values based on taxonomy are provided instead.The presented data set is limited by, among others, these select cases missing observed data, by errors and uncertainty in the expert assessment as presented in the literature, and by the lack of intraspecific information. However, the standardized and transparent nature and complete global coverage of the data set should support an array of potential studies in biogeography, community ecology, macroevolution, global change biology, and conservation. Potential uses include comparative work involving these traits as focal or secondary variables, ecological research on the trait or trophic structure of communities, or conservation science concerned with the loss of function among species or in ecosystems in a changing world. We hope that this publication will spur the sharing, collaborative curation, and extension of data to the benefit of a more integrative, rigorous, and global biodiversity science.},

	abstract = {Vegetation structure quantified by light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can improve understanding of wildlife occupancy and species-richness patterns. However, there is often a time lag between the collection of LiDAR data and wildlife data. We investigated whether a time lag between the LiDAR acquisition and field-data acquisition affected mapped wildlife distributions ranging from an individual species distribution to total avian species richness in a conifer forest. We collected bird and LiDAR data in 2009 across a 20,000ha forest in northern Idaho. Using the 2009 LiDAR data, we modelled the probability of occurrence for the brown creeper (Certhia americana). Using the same 2009 LiDAR data, we additionally modelled total avian species richness and richness of three different bird nesting guilds (ground/understory, mid/upper canopy and cavity). We mapped brown creeper occupancy probability and species richness using the 2009 models, and then compared these maps with maps based on the same models applied to a 2003-LiDAR dataset. A prior study identified areas harvested between 2003 and 2009. There was on average a 5\% absolute decrease in mapped probabilities of brown creeper occurrence in non-harvest areas between 2003 and 2009. Species richness changed by less than one species in all cases within non-harvest areas between the 2003 and 2009 maps. Although these comparisons were statistically significant at the p{\textless}0.0001 level, it is likely that the high number of map cells (similar to 480,000) influenced this result. Similar patterns between our 2003 and 2009 maps in non-harvest areas for this suite of avian responses suggests that a 6-year difference between field-data collection and LiDAR-data collection has a minimal effect on mapped avian patterns in an undisturbed coniferous forest. However, because this is one case study in one ecosystem, additional work examining the effect of temporal lags between LiDAR and field-data collection on mapping wildlife distributions is warranted in additional ecosystems.},

	abstract = {a b s t r a c t Most efforts to link remote sensing to species distributions and movement have focused on indirect esti-mates of traits based on components of physiological and functional biodiversity. Such a view reflects one perspective on the general needs (habitat) of species. However, information on the vertical and hori-zontal structure of habitat may play a critical role in defining what a suitable habitat is. The development and application of highly accurate airborne laser scanning (ALS) systems, which are capable of describing the three-dimensional distribution of vegetation, have significant potential value in deriving quantitative relationships between species distributions and their habitat structure. In this paper we review the use of ALS for biodiversity studies, and propose a three-dimensional index which captures the three main com-ponents of vertical and horizontal vegetation structure: height, cover, and complexity. Once developed, we apply the index across the forested area of the Canadian province of Alberta, and compare and con-trast the differences across natural subregions and land cover types. We also demonstrate how the index can be used with biodiversity data, in this case examining patterns in avian species richness. We con-clude with a discussion on the potential use of the habitat structure index with other biodiversity-related research.},

	abstract = {Management of restored areas requires ecologically meaningful spatial data providing objective measures of restoration success. Understanding relationships between species diversity on the one hand and habitat heterogeneity and productivity on the other can help establish such measures and prioritize restoration management. We used airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data to derive characteristics of vegetation structure, primary productivity and senescent vegetation (i.e. old dead vegetation) for prediction of richness and rarity of bird communities colonizing newly available habitats restored after coal mining. In addition, we analysed, which type of restoration (i.e. agricultural, forest, or spontaneous succession) results in more favourable conditions. The boosted regression trees explained 52\% and 12\% of deviance of overall species richness and rarity, respectively. We found that the overall species richness was strongly affected by the variance in vegetation structure, while the rarity was also affected by the presence of senescent vegetation. The relative importance of variables differed between the richness and rarity. The shrub cover had a strong positive effect on both, while the tree cover had a strong positive effect on species richness. The herbaceous cover and presence of senescent vegetation had positive effects on species rarity. This study, therefore, supports the necessity to create a mosaic of habitats with heterogeneous vertical structure including all layers of vegetation and highlights the importance of senescent vegetation. Combination of forests restoration with sites left to spontaneous succession appears to be the best strategy to increase both bird species richness and rarity in newly restored sites after coal mining.},

	abstract = {Within boreal forests of western North America, the dominant large-scale natural disturbance is wildfire. Thus, harvesting that is as similar as possible to fire is expected to best maintain natural bird communities. We reviewed studies of birds (mainly grouse, woodpeckers, and songbirds) from boreal forests of western North America and conducted meta-analyses to compare the similarity of bird communities occurring postfire versus postharvest. We compared the bird communities at five seral stages and also summarized the effects of retaining large live trees at harvest. Bird communities immediately postharvest differed greatly from those postfire. Differences between disturbance types disappeared as the forest regenerated, and both disturbance types became dominated by relatively few bird species in 31- to 75-year-old forests. During the period 76-125 years postdisturbance, old-forest birds became present and bird species richness increased. However, the trajectory of forest succession during this period influenced bird communities; old aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), old mixedwood, and old white spruce (Picea glauca Moench (Voss)) forests all had different bird communities. Retention of large live trees in cutblocks resulted in their use by many old-forest birds, but results were not consistent among studies. Although most bird species had clear peaks in abundance in a specific forest type, no species with more than five detections was limited to a single forest type.},

Therefore, increasing understanding of how organisms respond to degradation is essential for management and conservation planning. We were motivated by the need for rapid and practical analytical tools to assess the influence of management and degradation on biodiversity and system state in areas subject to rapid environmental change. We compared bird community composition and size in managed (ejido, i.e., communally owned lands) and unmanaged (national park) forests in the Sierra Tarahumara region, Mexico, using multispecies occupancy models and data from a 2-year breeding bird survey. Unmanaged sites had on average higher species occupancy and richness than managed sites. Most species were present in low numbers as indicated by lower values of detection and occupancy associated with logging-induced degradation. Less than 10\% of species had occupancy probabilities {\textgreater}0.5, and degradation had no positive effects on occupancy. The estimated metacommunity size of 125 exceeded previous estimates for the region, and sites with mature trees and uneven-aged forest stand characteristics contained the highest species richness. Higher estimation uncertainty and decreases in richness and occupancy for all species, including habitat generalists, were associated with degraded young, even-aged stands. Our findings show that multispecies occupancy methods provide tractable measures of biodiversity and system state and valuable decision support for landholders and managers. These techniques can be used to rapidly address gaps in biodiversity information, threats to biodiversity, and vulnerabilities of species of interest on a landscape level, even in degraded or fast-changing environments. Moreover, such tools may be particularly relevant in the assessment of species richness and distribution in a wide array of habitats.},

	abstract = {Vegetation structure is an important factor that influences wildlife-habitat selection, reproduction, and survival. However, field-based measurements of vegetation structure can be time consuming, costly, and difficult to undertake in areas that are remote and/or contain rough terrain. Light detection and ranging (lidar) is an active remote sensing technology that can quantify three-dimensional vegetation structure over large areas and thus holds promise for examining wildlife-habitat relationships. We used discrete-return airborne lidar data acquired over the Black Hills Experimental Forest in South Dakota, USA in combination with field-collected vegetation and bird data to assess the utility of lidar data in quantifying vegetation structural characteristics that relate to avian diversity, density, and occurrence. Indices of foliage height diversity calculated from lidar data were positively and significantly correlated with indices of bird species diversity, with the highest correlations observed when foliage height diversity categories contained proportionally more foliage layers near the forest floor ({\textless} 5 m). In addition, lidar-derived indices of vegetation volume were significantly correlated with bird density. Using lidar-derived vegetation height data in combination with multispectral IKONOS data, we delineated five general habitat types within the study area according to the presence of prominent vegetation layers at lower levels of the forest and predominant tree type (deciduous or conifer). Habitat type delineations were tested by examining the occurrence and relative density of two bird species common to the study area that prefer lower level vegetation for foraging and nesting. Dark-eyed Juncos were significantly associated with the 0.5-2.0 m high vegetation layer in pine-dominated stands, and Warbling Vireos were significantly associated with this same layer in aspen-dominated stands. These results demonstrate that discrete-return lidar can be an effective tool to remotely quantify vegetation structural attributes important to birds, and may be enhanced when used in combination with spectral data. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Conserving multiple facets of biodiversity is important for sustaining ecosystems. However, understanding relationships between faunal diversity and measurable ecosystem quantities, such as heterogeneity and productivity, across continental scales can be complicated by disparate methods. We developed standardized approaches using lidar data and spectral greenness data (via NOVI; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from 637 sampling plots across four sites in North America, Europe, and Asia to test the local effects of habitat heterogeneity and productivity on taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of breeding bird assemblages using boosted generalized additive models. Our results revealed the 3-D (three dimensional) vegetation structure (horizontal and vertical) to be of similar importance as NDVI in multiple biodiversity measures, and the importance of 3-D structure was higher for functional and phylogenetic biodiversity measures than for taxonomic measures. We found congruent responses between functional and phylogenetic diversity; however, patterns of taxonomic diversity differed from those of functional/phylogenetic diversity for most predictors. For example, NDVI had positive relationships with taxonomic diversity, but negative relationships with functional/ phylogenetic diversity. The effect of canopy density on taxonomic diversity was generally bell-shaped, whereas the relationship was U-shaped for functional and phylogenetic diversity. As a result, this study supports a silviculture strategy with a high variety of canopy densities and vertical variabilities across forest stands to create maximum benefits for regional biodiversity. Here, early succession stands and closed stands sustain functionally-rich bird assemblages, while stands with a medium canopy density promote species-rich assemblages.},

Bird communities were censused using a 100-m fixed-radius point-count technique before and after logging on the same cut blocks to obtain estimates of species richness and bird abundances. Harvesting reduced both species richness and bird abundance, but both parameters declined less in partial cuts than in clearcuts. Ground-dwelling birds had similar abundance before and after harvesting, but the abundance of individuals of tree- and shrub-inhabiting birds decreased with the amount of remaining vegetation cover. Fourteen of 36 species declined significantly in abundance following logging. Seven of eight species that were absent from clearcuts were retained at very low abundances in partial cuts. Pending the collection of longer term data on reproductive success, we suggest that retention levels of residual vegetation up to 40\% on cutover areas can benefit bird communities when used as one technique in a large-scale forest management strategy},

	abstract = {The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

LiDAR can become a decisive technology by providing accurate information about the linkages between biodiversity and ecosystem structure. Here, we review the current use of LiDAR metrics in ecological studies regarding birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates, bryophytes, lichens, and fungi (BLF). We quantify the types of research (ecosystem and LiDAR sources) and describe the LiDAR platforms and data that are currently available. We also categorize and harmonize LiDAR metrics into five LiDAR morphological traits (canopy cover, height and vertical distribution, understory and shrubland, and topographic traits) and quantify their current use and effectiveness across taxonomic groups and ecosystems. The literature review returned 173 papers that met our criteria. Europe and North America held most of the studies, and birds were the most studied group, whereas temperate forest was by far the most represented ecosystem. Globally, canopy height was the most used LiDAR trait, especially in forest ecosystems, whereas canopy cover and terrain topography traits performed better in those ecosystems where they were mapped. Understory structure and shrubland traits together with terrain topography showed high effectiveness for less studied groups such as BLF and invertebrates and in open landscapes. Our results show how LiDAR technology has greatly contributed to habitat mapping, including organisms poorly studied until recently, such as BLF. Finally, we discuss the forthcoming opportunities for biodiversity mapping with different LiDAR platforms in combination with spectral information. We advocate (i) for the integration of spaceborne LiDAR data with the already available airborne (airplane, drones) and terrestrial technology, and (ii) the coupling of it with multispectral/hyperspectral information, which will allow for the exploration and analyses of new species and ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Ecological niche theory implies that more heterogeneous habitats have the potential to support greater biodiversity. Positive heterogeneity-diversity relationships have been found for most studies investigating animal taxa, although negative relationships also occur and the scale dependence of heterogeneity-diversity relationships is little known. We investigated multi-scale, heterogeneity-diversity relationships for bird communities in a semi-arid riparian landscape, using airborne LiDAR data to derive key measures of structural habitat complexity. Habitat heterogeneity-diversity relationships were generally positive, although the overall strength of relationships varied across avian life history guilds (R2 range: 0.03-0.41). Best predicted were the species richness indices of cavity nesters, habitat generalists, woodland specialists, and foliage foragers. Heterogeneity-diversity relationships were also strongly scale-dependent, with strongest associations at the 200-m scale (4ha) and weakest associations at the 50-m scale (0.25ha). Our results underscore the value of LiDAR data for fine-grained quantification of habitat structure, as well as the need for biodiversity studies to incorporate variation among life-history guilds and to simultaneously consider multiple guild functional types (e.g. nesting, foraging, habitat). Results suggest that certain life-history guilds (foliage foragers, cavity nesters, woodland specialists) are more susceptible than others (ground foragers, ground nesters, low nesters) to experiencing declines in local species richness if functional elements of habitat heterogeneity are lost. Positive heterogeneity-diversity relationships imply that riparian conservation efforts need to not only provide high-quality riparian habitat locally, but also to provide habitat heterogeneity across multiple scales. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

	abstract = {Boreal and mountainous forests are a primary focus of conservation efforts and are naturally prone to large-scale disturbances, such as outbreaks of bark beetles. Affected stands are characterised by biological legacies which persist through the disturbance and subsequent succession. The lack of long-term monitoring data on post disturbance forest structure precludes understanding of the complex pathways by which natural disturbances affect forest structure and subsequently species presence. We analysed the response of capercaillie (Tetrao urogolhis) and hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia) to bark beetle infestations. We combined high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) with a 23-year time series of aerial photography to quantify present-day forest structure and stand disturbance history. Species presence was assessed by collecting droppings of hazel grouse and capercaillie in a citizen science project. Structural equation models showed that the probability of hazel grouse presence increased with increasing disturbance, and the probability of both hazel grouse and capercaillie presence increased with succession. Indirect effects of bark beetle infestations, such as a reduced abundance of deciduous trees and an enhanced herb layer cover, were positively associated with capercaillie presence. Decreasing canopy cover increased the probability of hazel grouse presence. The high temporal and spatial heterogeneity of bark beetle infestations created forest structures that meet the contrasting habitat requirements of both, capercaillie and hazel grouse.

	abstract = {Taxonomic and functional diversity of animals respond to habitat heterogeneity. However, how structural heterogeneity at the stand level of differently managed forests drives species richness across taxa is not clear. Here we analyze how birds and bats, sharing the ability to fly, respond to the structural composition of the vegetation layers in differently managed forests. We combined datasets of birds and bats and compared their response as taxonomic vs. functional richness towards forest structure. Overall our results revealed that bird and bat species richness were positively correlated and spedei richness of both taxa peaked within the same forest stands. In contrast to our prediction that richness of mobile vertebrates with similar ecological traits (the ability to fly) should respond alike to forest stand characteristics, our results showed almost no congruence. Using Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Modeling (GLMM) with model selection based on AICc and model averaging, we found that taxonomic richness of birds and bats as well as functional richness (based on main diet and foraging mode) responded to forest structure in very different ways. While the taxonomic richness of birds was mainly associated with the structural parameters contrast and forest height, representing tall trees and a relatively closed canopy, richness of bat species increased with vertical and horizontal heterogeneity within forest stands. Our findings indicate that functional richness is more useful to understand responses of bird and bats species richness to land use, forest structure and forest management, rather than focusing solely on taxonomic groups.},

	abstract = {Habitat suitability models are based on digital maps that very often describe the environment at a human scale and, hence miss ecological structures and features that are important for wildlife. LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data, laser scanning acquired by remote sensing, can fill this gap by providing useful information not only on the spatial extent of habitat types but also information on the vertical height. The advantage of LiDAR derived variables lays also in the availability at a large scale, instead of just in the survey sites. In this work we evaluated the effect of three LiDAR derived variables (tree height, percentage of trees in open areas and length of ecotone) on the performance of habitat models, developed for four farmland bird species. For each species multiple runs of stepwise Logistic Regression (LR) and Maximum Entropy Models (Maxent) were performed. For each run we included and excluded the LiDAR variables and recorded the improvement in model performance using the AUC, AIC, Sensitivity, Specificity. Model results were applied in a GIS in order to create habitat suitability maps. Results for the RL models showed that for most of the species at least one LiDAR variable was selected and significant (p{\textless} 0.05). Additionally the inclusion LIDAR data gave a positive percentage of contribution to the AUC of the Maxent models. The models calculated using LiDAR derived variables identified a smaller area on the map, with a better overlap with open areas, thus showing a more realistic spatial pattern. The interpretation of these variable is also more straightforward, both from the ecological point of view and when defining management guidelines. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We estimated singing rates and EDR for 75 boreal forest songbird species and found that survey protocol, especially point-count radius, explained most of the variation in detectability. However, environmental and temporal covariates (date, time, vegetation) affected singing rates and EDR for 73\% and 59\% of species, respectively. Unadjusted survey counts increased by an average of 201\% from a 5-min, 50-m radius survey to a 10-min, 100-m radius survey (n = 75 species).

Research undertaken over the last 30 years has given us a very different perspective of the complexity of Canadian boreal forests. Old-growth forests are common and their development is controlled by nonfire disturbances. Consequently, monospecific even-aged stands can develop towards more diversified uneven-aged stands with increasing time since fire. This complex disturbance regime, including both fire and nonfire disturbances, is partially responsible for a higher than expected biodiversity (e.g., understory) in these forests. The dominating forest management model in Canadian boreal forests, based on clear-cut harvesting and regeneration of short rotation even-aged stands, does not reflect the complexities of the disturbance-succession cycle observed in Canadian natural boreal forests.},

Here, we review the current state of avian SDMs and point to challenges and future opportunities for specific applications, ranging from conservation biology, invasive species and predicting seabird distributions, to more general topics such as modeling avian diversity, niche evolution and seasonal distributions at a biogeographic scale. While SDMs have been criticized for being phenomenological in nature, and for their inability to explicitly account for a variety of processes affecting populations, we conclude that they remain a powerful tool to learn about past, current, and future species distributions – at least when their limitations and assumptions are recognized and addressed. We close our review by providing an outlook on prospects and synergies with other disciplines in which avian SDMs can play an important role.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. We studied the effect of habitat fragmentation on the richness, diversity, turnover, and abundance of breeding bird communities in old, boreal mixed-wood forest by creating isolated and connected forest fragments of 1, 10, 40, and 100 ha. Connected fragments were linked by 100 m wide riparian buffer strips. Each size class within treatments and controls was replicated three times. We sampled the passerine community using point counts before, and in each of two years after, forest harvesting, accumulating 21 340 records representing 59 species. We detected no significant change in species richness as a result of the harvesting, except in the 1-ha connected fragments, where the number of species increased two years after isolation. This increase was accounted for by transient species, suggesting that the adjacent buffer strips were being used as movement corridors. Diversity (log series alpha index) was dependent on area in the isolated fragments only after cutting, having decreased in the smaller areas. Turnover rates in the isolated fragments were sig-nificantly higher than in similar connected or control areas, due to species replacement. Crowding occurred in the isolated fragments immediately after cutting, but two years after fragmentation, the responses in abundance of species varied with migratory strategy. Num-bers of Neotropical migrants declined in both connected and isolated fragments, and resident species declined in isolated fragments. Most species in these groups require older forest, many favoring interior areas. Abundance of short-distance migrants, most of which are habitat generalists, did not change. Overall, although there was no decrease in species richness from our recently fragmented areas, community structure was altered; maintaining connections between fragments helped to mitigate these effects. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the fragmentation effects we documented is small compared with those observed else-where. Birds breeding in the boreal forest, where frequent small-and large-scale natural disturbances have occurred historically, may be more resilient to human-induced habitat changes, such as those caused by forest harvesting. However, these results should be in-terpreted with caution. First, they are short-term and address only broad-scale community responses based on species richness and relative abundance. Second, the study area was embedded in a landscape where large areas of old, mixed forest are still available, potentially dampening any local-scale impacts of fragmentation.},

	abstract = {The boreal zone and its ecosystems provide numerous provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services. Because of its resources and its hydroelectric potential, Canada's boreal zone is important to the country's resource-based economy. The region presently occupied by Canada's boreal zone has experienced dramatic changes during the past 3 million years as the climate cooled and repeated glaciations affected both the biota and the landscape. For about the past 7000 years, climate, fire, insects, diseases, and their interactions have been the most important natural drivers of boreal ecosystem dynamics, including rejuvenation, biogeochemical cycling, maintenance of productivity, and landscape variability. Layered upon natural drivers are changes increasingly caused by people and development and those related to human-caused climate change. Effects of these agents vary spatially and temporally, and, as global population increases, the demands and impacts on ecosystems will likely increase. Understanding how humans directly affect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in Canada's boreal zone and how these effects and actions interact with natural disturbance agents is a prerequisite for informed and adaptive decisions about management of natural resources, while maintaining the economy and environment upon which humans depend. This paper reports on the genesis and present condition of the boreal zone and its ecosystems and sets the context for a detailed scientific investigation in subsequent papers published in this journal on several key aspects: carbon in boreal forests; climate change consequences, adaptation, and mitigation; nutrient and elemental cycling; protected areas; status, impacts, and risks of non-native species; factors affecting sustainable timber harvest levels; terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity; and water and wetland resources. © 2013 Published by NRC Research Press.},

Here, we introduce LT for the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The GEE platform simplifies pre-processing steps, allowing focus on the translation of the core temporal segmentation algorithm. Temporal segmentation involved a series of repeated random access calls to each pixel's time series, resulting in a set of breakpoints ("vertices") that bound straight-line segments. The translation of the algorithm into GEE included both transliteration and code analysis, resulting in improvement and logic error fixes. At six study areas representing diverse land cover types across the U.S., we conducted a direct comparison of the new LT-GEE code against the heritage code (LT-IDL). The algorithms agreed in most cases, and where disagreements occurred, they were largely attributable to logic error fixes in the code translation process. The practical impact of these changes is minimal, as shown by an example of forest disturbance mapping. We conclude that the LT-GEE algorithm represents a faithful translation of the LT code into a platform easily accessible by the broader user community.},

	abstract = {Advances in remotely sensed data for characterizing habitat have enabled development of spatially explicit predictive species distribution models (SDM) that can be essential tools for management. SDMs commonly use coarse-grain metrics, such as forest patch size or patch connectivity, over broad spatial extents. However, species distributions are likely driven in part by local, fine-grained habitat conditions. Conservation and management are often planned and applied locally, where coarse predictions may be uninformative or not sufficiently precise. We investigated the integration of high-resolution LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) with avian point sampling data to develop a detection-corrected occupancy model to quantify habitat-occurrence relationships for two species with different habitats: the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) and black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) on a military installation in central Texas. We compared occupancy models that used only the more conventional, coarse remotely sensed metrics to models that also incorporated high-resolution LiDAR-derived metrics for vegetation height and canopy cover, to assess their use for predicting distributions. Models including LiDAR-derived vegetation height and canopy cover metrics were competitive for both species, and models without LiDAR-derived vegetation height had substantially lower model weights and explanatory strength. Area under curve estimates for the highest ranked models were high for warblers (0.864) and moderate for vireos (0.746). Using the best supported models for each species, we predicted the occurrence distribution for both species. The resulting predictions provide a decision support tool that enables assessment of the status, impacts, and mitigation of impacts to endangered species habitat on the installation due to land management and military training activities that is more standardized and accurate than current assessment approaches based on visual gestalt of habitat and expert opinion. Additionally, although previous species distribution models have been created for our focal species, most fail to match the grain and extent of most management actions or include local, fine-grained metrics that influence distributions. In contrast, we demonstrate that use of LiDAR with species occurrence data can provide precision and resolution at a scale that is relevant ecologically and to the operational scale of most conservation and management actions.},

We evaluated an underexplored dimension of the mismatch between climate and biota: limitations to forest growth and succession affecting habitat suitability. Our objective was to inform continental-scale conservation for boreal songbirds under disequilibria between climate, vegetation and fauna. LocationBoreal and southern arctic ecoregions of North America. MethodsWe used forest inventory and avian survey data to classify 53 species by seral-stage affinity and applied these to generate alternative projections of changes in species' core habitat distributions based on different vegetation lag-time assumptions. We used our seral stage-modified refugia approach and the Zonation algorithm to identify multispecies boreal conservation priorities over the 21st century. We evaluated the sensitivity of land rankings to seral-stage affinity and species' weights and assessed the conservation value of the existing protected areas network compared to Zonation results. ResultsEnd-of-century projected changes in songbird distribution were reduced by up to 169\% when vegetation lags were considered. Zonation land rankings based on unconstrained climate projections were concentrated at high latitudes, whereas those based on strict and modified refugia scenarios were concentrated in coastal and high-elevation areas, as well as biome transition zones, which were fairly consistent over time and species weights. The existing protected areas network covering 14\% of the study area was estimated to conserve 12-14\% of baseline avian biodiversity across time periods and scenarios, compared to 16-25\% for top-ranked Zonation areas. Main conclusionsFor some boreal songbirds, limits to forest growth and succession may result in dramatic reductions in suitable habitat over the next century. Our seral stage-adjusted approach provides conservative and efficient boreal conservation priorities anchored around climatic macrorefugia that are robust to century-long climate change and complement the current protected areas network.},

	abstract = {Silvicultural treatments have been shown to alter the composition of species assemblages in numerous taxa. However, the intensity and persistence of these effects have rarely been documented. We used a before-after, control-impact (BACI) paired design, i.e., five pairs of 25-ha study plots, 1-control and 1-treated plot, to quantify changes in the density of eight forest bird species in response to selection harvesting over six breeding seasons, one year pre- and five years postharvest. Focal species included mature forest associates, i.e., Northern Parula (Setophaga americana) and Black-throated Green Warbler (Setophaga virens), forest generalists, i.e., Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius) and Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), early-seral specialists, i.e., Mourning Warbler (Geothlypis philadelphia) and Chestnut-sided Warbler (Setophaga pensylvanica), species associated with shrubby forest gaps, i.e., Black-throated Blue Warbler (Setophaga caerulescens), and mid-seral species, i.e., American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla). As predicted, we found a negative numerical response to the treatment in the Black-throated Green Warbler, no treatment effect in the Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, and a positive treatment effect in early-seral specialists. We only detected a year effect in the Northern Parula and the American Redstart. There was evidence for a positive treatment effect on the Swainson's Thrush when the regeneration started to reach the pole stage, i.e., fifth year postharvest. These findings suggest that selection harvesting has the potential to maintain diverse avian assemblages while allowing sustainable management of timber supply, but future studies should determine whether mature-forest associates can sustain second-and third-entry selection harvest treatments.},

	abstract = {Aim: Species distribution modelling, a family of statistical methods that predicts species distributions from a set of occurrences and environmental predictors, is now routinely applied in many macroecological studies. However, the reliability of evaluation metrics usually employed to validate these models remains questioned. Moreover, the emergence of online databases of environmental variables with global coverage, especially climatic, has favoured the use of the same set of standard predictors. Unfortunately, the selection of variables is too rarely based on a careful examination of the species' ecology. In this context, our aim was to highlight the importance of selecting ad hoc variables in species distribution models, and to assess the ability of classical evaluation statistics to identify models with no biological realism. Innovation: First, we reviewed the current practices in the field of species distribution modelling in terms of variable selection and model evaluation. Then, we computed distribution models of 509 European species using pseudo-predictors derived from paintings or using a real set of climatic and topographic predictors. We calculated model performance based on the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and true skill statistics (TSS), partitioning occurrences into training and test data with different levels of spatial independence. Most models computed from pseudo-predictors were classified as good and sometimes were even better evaluated than models computed using real environmental variables. However, on average they were better discriminated when the partitioning of occurrences allowed testing for model transferability. Main conclusions: These findings confirm the crucial importance of variable selection and the inability of current evaluation metrics to assess the biological significance of distribution models. We recommend that researchers carefully select variables according to the species' ecology and evaluate models only according to their capacity to be transfered in distant areas. Nevertheless, statistics of model evaluations must still be interpreted with great caution.},

	abstract = {The widespread use of spatial planning tools in conjunction with increases in the availability of geographic information systems and associated data has led to the rapid growth in the exploration and application of species distribution models. Conservation professionals can choose from a considerable number of modelling techniques, but there has been relatively little evaluation of predictive performance, data requirements, or type of inference of these models. Empirical data for woodland caribou Rangifier tarandus caribou was used to examine four species distribution models, namely a qualitative habitat suitability index and quantitative resource selection function, Mahalanobis distance and ecological niche models. Models for three sets of independent variables were developed and then a temporally independent set of caribou locations evaluated predictive performance. The similarity of species distribution maps among the four modelling approaches was also quantified. All of the quantitative species distribution models were good predictors of the validation data set, but the spatial distribution of mapped habitats differed considerably among models. These results suggest that choice of model and variable set could influence the identification of areas for conservation emphasis. Model choice may be limited by the type of species locations or desired inference. Conservation professionals should choose a model and variable set based on the question, the ecology of the species and the availability of requisite data.},

	abstract = {This study tested the hypothesis that habitat structure dictates the distribution and community composition of arboreal arthropods. A diverse arthropod assemblage of Douglas-fir canopies, which included Araneae, Psocoptera a. Collembola and Homoptera, was chosen as a model system. Habitat structural diversity, defined as needle density and branching complexity of Douglas-fir branches, was manipulated in a four-month experiment by needle removal, thinning and tying of branches. Abundance of canopy spiders declined significantly following needle density reduction and branch thinning, branch tying significantly increased spider abundance. Distinct habitat utilization patterns were found among individual spider guilds. Orb weavers (Araneidae) dominated spider assemblages in structurally simple habitats, whereas tied branches were colonized primarily by sheet-web weavers (Linyphiidae) and nocturnal hunting spiders (Anyphaenidae and Clubionidae). Spider species richness and average body size of several spider species increased in structurally more complex habitats. Arboreal spiders appeared to be limited by strong bottom-up effects in the form of habitat quality and, to a lesser degree, prey availability. Habitat manipulations did not affect densities or biomass of flying arthropod colonists in the branch vicinity. Needle removal and branch thinning led to a significant decline in the abundance of Psocoptera and Collembola. Tying of branches resulted in an eight-fold increase in Collembola numbers. organisms most sensitive to habitat alterations. Canopy habitat structure modified vertical dispersal of Collembola from forest litter, which may have significant implications for arboreal consumers. Our results lend strong support to the importance of habitat structural diversity in explaining general patterns of arthropod abundance and diversity on plants.},

Currently, about two-thirds of the area covered by this biome is under some form of management, mostly for wood production. Services such as climate regulation are also provided by both the unmanaged and managed boreal forests. Although most of the boreal forests have retained the resilience to cope with current disturbances, projected environmental changes of unprecedented speed and amplitude pose a substantial threat to their health. Management options to reduce these threats are available and could be implemented, but economic incentives and a greater focus on the boreal biome in international fora are needed to support further adaptation and mitigation actions.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, fire is used as a management tool to mitigate wildfire risk and conserve biodiversity. Use of time since disturbance as a surrogate for faunal occurrence presents an appealing basis for biodiversity conservation; however, successional change in resource availability is often the direct driver of change in animal occurrence rather than time per se, and rates of resource development can be highly variable. To facilitate prediction of animal responses to disturbance, we sought to test whether time since fire (TSF) and habitat structure can predict bird occurrence. Time is only expected to predict occurrence if (i) species respond to structural resources and (ii) the abundance of these resources can be predicted by time. We examined the responses of 15 bird species to habitat structure and TSF using a 70-year chronosequence spanning three forest types in southeast Australia. Habitat structure variables predicted the occurrence of 13 species, four of which also responded to TSF. The levels of associations between occurrence, structure and TSF varied among vegetation types but response shapes were generally consistent. The fact that the majority of species did not respond to TSF indicates that TSF is an inappropriate surrogate for avian occurrence in our study system. Further, it is unlikely to be a reliable surrogate for faunal occurrence in forests that exhibit variable rates of post-fire structural development. We suggest that relationships between TSF and structure can provide insight into the capacity of TSF to predict animal occurrence. They will also reveal the extent to which fire can be used as a tool for managing biodiversity, and species likely to benefit or be at risk from particular fire regimes. This is critical given projected increases in the frequency and extent of fire in many regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	volume = {12},
	issn = {1051-0761},
	abstract = {Building or maintaining corridors in fragmented landscapes may be an important method to conserve gap-sensitive species that avoid crossing gaps in forest cover. We tested the effectiveness of corridors by examining the changes in abundance of boreal birds pre- and post-logging in experimental 10-ha and 40-ha reserves that were isolated or connected by corridors, relative to their abundance responses in continuous forest (reference sites). Prior to the analysis, we categorized birds as to their predicted gap sensitivity based on two measures: their use of corridors and gap-crossing behavior in small-scale trials, and their habitat affinities (forest species vs. habitat generalists). The abundance of forest species as a group was consistently higher in reference reserves than in isolated or connected reserves after harvest, except for the first year, after harvest, when crowding occurred in isolates. Habitat generalist species showed no differences in abundances across reserve types. As a group, resident species were more abundant in reference and connected reserves than in isolates in three of five years post-harvest, suggesting that corridors might benefit these species. None of the single species analyzed showed consistent evidence of benefiting from corridors. Although four species were most abundant in connected reserves after harvest, their abundances were not significantly lower in isolates than in reference sites. Behavioral classification (gap-crossing propensity) was not useful in classifying single species as to how gap sensitive they would be in response to our experiment: habitat affinity was a better predictor. We suggest that corridors may be useful to retain resident birds on harvested landscapes, but that corridors connecting small reserves of forest are unlikely to offset the impacts of fragmentation for most boreal birds. Assessments of the utility of corridors must, however, be done in the context of the full plant and animal communities that live in the boreal forest.},

	abstract = {This review highlights the latest developments associated with the use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in ecology. Over the last decade, the NDVI has proven extremely useful in predicting herbivore and non-herbivore distribution, abundance and life history traits in space and time. Due to the continuous nature of NDVI since mid-1981, the relative importance of different temporal and spatial lags on population performance can be assessed, widening our understanding of population dynamics. Previously thought to be most useful in temperate environments, the utility of this satellite-derived index has been demonstrated even in sparsely vegetated areas. Climate models can be used to reconstruct historical patterns in vegetation dynamics in addition to anticipating the effects of future environmental change on biodiversity. NDVI has thus been established as a crucial tool for assessing past and future population and biodiversity consequences of change in climate, vegetation phenology and primary productivity.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.rse.2010.08.024},
	abstract = {Heat waves are expected to become more frequent and severe as climate changes, with unknown consequences for biodiversity. We sought to identify ecologically-relevant broad-scale indicators of heat waves based on MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and interpolated air temperature data and assess their associations with avian community structure. Specifically, we asked which data source, time periods, and heat wave indices best predicted changes in avian abundance and species richness. Using mixed effects models, we analyzed associations between these indices and data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey in the central United States between 2000 and 2007 in four ecoregions and five migratory and nesting species groups. We then quantified avian responses to scenarios of severe, but commonly-occurring early, late, and summer-long heat waves. Indices based on MODIS LST data, rather than interpolated air temperatures, were more predictive of avian community structure. Avian communities were more related to 8-day LST exceedances (positive anomalies only); and were generally more sensitive to summer-long heat waves. Across the region, abundance, and to a lesser extent, species richness, declined following heat waves. Among the ecoregions, relationships were most consistently negative in the southern and montane ecoregions, but were positive in a more humid northern ecoregion. Among migratory groups, permanent resident species were the most sensitive, declining in abundance following a summer-long heat wave by 19\% and 13\% in the montane and southern ecoregions, respectively. Ground-nesting species, which declined in the south by 12\% following a late summer heat wave, were more sensitive than avifauna overall. These results demonstrate the value of MODIS LST data for measuring ecologically-relevant heat waves across large regions. Ecologically, these findings highlight the importance of extreme events for avian biodiversity and the considerable variation in response to environmental change associated with different functional groups and geographic regions. The magnitude of the relationships between avian abundance and heat waves reported here raises concerns about the impacts of more frequent and severe heat waves in a warming climate.

	abstract = {Obtaining accurate and widespread measurements of the vertical structure of the Earth’s forests has been a long-sought goal for the ecological community. Such observations are critical for accurately assessing the existing biomass of forests, and how changes in this biomass caused by human activities or variations in climate may impact atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Additionally, the three-dimensional structure of forests is a key component of habitat quality and biodiversity at local to regional scales. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) was launched to the International Space Station in late 2018 to provide high-quality measurements of forest vertical structure in temperate and tropical forests between 51.6° N \& S latitude. The GEDI instrument is a geodetic-class laser altimeter/waveform lidar comprised of 3 lasers that produce 8 transects of structural information. Over its two-year nominal lifetime GEDI is anticipated to provide over 10 billion waveforms at a footprint resolution of 25 ​m. These data will be used to derive a variety of footprint and gridded products, including canopy height, canopy foliar profiles, Leaf Area Index (LAI), sub-canopy topography and biomass. Additionally, data from GEDI are used to demonstrate the efficacy of its measurements for prognostic ecosystem modeling, habit and biodiversity studies, and for fusion using radar and other remote sensing instruments. GEDI science and technology are unique: no other space-based mission has been created that is specifically optimized for retrieving vegetation vertical structure. As such, GEDI promises to advance our understanding of the importance of canopy vertical variations within an ecological paradigm based on structure, composition and function.},

	abstract = {Detailed information on habitat needs is integral to identify conservation measures for declining species. However, field data on habitat structure is typically limited in extent. Remote sensing has the potential to overcome these limitations of field-based studies. We aimed to assess abiotic and biotic characteristics of territories used by the declining wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix), a forest-interior migratory passerine, at two spatial scales by evaluating a priori expectations of habitat selection patterns. First, territories established by males before pairing, referred to as pre-breeding territories, were compared to pseudo-absence control areas located in the wider forested landscape (first spatial scale, N-territories = 66, N-controls = 66). Second, breeding territories of paired wood warblers were compared to true-absence control areas located immediately close-by in the forest (second spatial scale, N-territories = 78, N-controls = 78). Habitat variables predominantly described forest structure and were mainly based on first and last pulse lidar (light detection and ranging) data. Occurrence of pre-breeding territories was related to vegetation height, vertical diversity and stratification, canopy cover, inclination and solar radiation. Occurrence of breeding territories was associated to vegetation height, vertical diversity and inclination. Territory selection at the two spatial scales addressed was governed by similar factors. With respect to conservation, habitat suitability for wood warblers could be retained by maintaining a shifting mosaic of stand ages and structures at large spatial scales. Moreover, leaf-off lidar variables have the potential to contribute to understanding the ecological niche of species in predominantly deciduous forests.},

Vegetation structure is a key characteristic of avian habitat, and can play a significant role in influencing habitat quality. Airborne lidar provides a means of measuring vegetation structure, supplying accurate data at high post-spacing and on a landscape-scale, which is impossible to achieve with field-based methods. We investigated how climate affected habitat quality using great tits (Parus major) breeding in woodland in eastern England. Mean chick body mass was used as a measure of habitat quality. Mean canopy height, calculated from a lidar digital canopy height model, was used as a measure of habitat structure. The influence of canopy height on body mass was examined for seven years during which weather conditions varied. The slopes and correlation coefficients of the mass/height relationships were related linearly to the warmth sum, an index of spring warmth, such that chick mass declined with canopy height in cold, late springs, but increased with height in warm, early springs. The parameters of the mass/height relationships, and the warmth sum, were also related linearly to the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index, but with a time lag of one year. Within the same wood, the structure conferring “best” habitat quality differed between years depending on weather conditions.},

	abstract = {Using remotely-sensed metrics to identify regions containing high animal diversity and/or specific animal species or guilds can help prioritize forest management and conservation objectives across actively managed landscapes. We predicted avian species richness in two mixed conifer forests, Moscow Mountain and Slate Creek, containing different management contexts and located in north-central Idaho. We utilized general linear models and an AIC model selection approach to examine the relative importance of a wide range of remotely-sensed ecological variables, including LiDAR-derived metrics of vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneities of both vegetation and terrain, and Landsat-derived vegetation reflectance indices. We also examined the relative importance of these remotely sensed variables in predicting nesting guild distributions of ground/understory nesters, midupper canopy nesters, and cavity nesters. All top models were statistically significant, with adjusted R(2)s ranging from 0.05 to 0.42. Regardless of study area, the density of the understory was positively associated with total species richness and the ground/understory nesting guild. However, the relative importance of ecological predictors generally differed between the study areas and among the nesting guilds. For example, for mid-upper canopy nester richness, the best predictors at Moscow Mountain included height variability and canopy density whereas at Slate Creek they included slope, elevation, patch diversity and height variability. Topographic variables were not found to influence species richness at Moscow Mountain but were strong predictors of avian species richness at the higher elevation Slate Creek, where species richness decreased with increasing slope and elevation. A variance in responses between focal areas suggests that we expand such studies to determine the relative importance of different factors in determining species richness. It is also important to note that managers using predictive maps should realize that models from one region may not adequately represent communities in other areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
